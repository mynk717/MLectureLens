00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.680
Alright, so the next topic

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.480
we are going to study

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.280
in this object oriented programming

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.520
is attribute shadowing.

5
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.280
What is attribute shadowing?

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.440
The term sounds really fancy,

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.640
but the implementation

8
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.480
is super easy.

9
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.760
The concept is easy, but it

10
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.160
has its own meaning.

11
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600
So without wasting any more time, I

12
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.000
would like to take you directly to

13
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.880
the code part because this is

14
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.240
actually super easy to understand

15
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.640
in the code, rather code rather

16
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.250
than the diagrams and all these

17
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.570
stuff.

18
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.010
So let's create a new file.

19
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.810
Call this one as 03 and this

20
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.090
one is attribute shadowing.

21
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.530
Shadow shadowing.

22
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.290
There we go.

23
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.170
Py.

24
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.010
All right, so we have

25
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.250
seen a couple of things.

26
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.650
First thing that you know that this

27
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.410
is hot is known as attribute.

28
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.460
Yes, these are technically variables.

29
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.580
We have seen variables.

30
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.500
So yeah, internally they are

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.020
just variable just like this.

32
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.020
So I can just go ahead

33
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.700
and work on this.

34
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
This is also a variable.

35
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.020
So these are exchangeable.

36
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.220
We can call attribute as

37
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.940
variable, variable as attribute.

38
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.300
But the only difference that comes

39
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.140
up here is when you

40
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.580
actually go ahead and have

41
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.420
this inside a class or an object.

42
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.460
So when it goes inside

43
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.180
an object or technically a class,

44
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.810
this whole thing variable

45
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.090
is called as attribute.

46
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.770
Yeah, the functionality remains same.

47
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.970
There's no change at all.

48
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.970
We just like to call it different.

49
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.250
So that is all.

50
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.210
So you got the first

51
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.090
part, the attribute.

52
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.330
But what is the shadowing

53
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.570
for this, shadowing.

54
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.250
Let's go ahead and have

55
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.610
a simple class.

56
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.450
Let's call this one again as chai.

57
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.170
There we go.

58
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.370
And this chai class has temperature.

59
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.530
So each chai has its own temperature.

60
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.290
And maybe the temperature

61
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.050
we are going for is hot.

62
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.340
Good enough.

63
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.820
And what's the strength of the chai?

64
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.220
The chai has different strength, like

65
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.740
strong, mild, light, all of that.

66
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.100
This one is by default strong.

67
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.060
Strong chai.

68
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.260
All right, let's go into this.

69
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.339
So let's just say we have

70
00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:07.340
a cutting chai which comes

71
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.380
from the chai itself.

72
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.620
So this cutting has all

73
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.979
the properties, temperature

74
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.660
and the strength as well.

75
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.500
I go ahead and say that, hey,

76
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.790
I want to print

77
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.390
this cutting chai as temperature.

78
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.190
So can I go ahead and print this?

79
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.590
You might be thinking, all right,

80
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.950
I can go ahead and do that.

81
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.430
No much of an issue.

82
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.870
There we go.

83
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.830
It gets a hot.

84
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.510
All right, everything expected.

85
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.350
Now what happens if I go ahead

86
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.350
and take this cutting chai and take

87
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.230
its temperature and instead of

88
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.100
the hot, I convert this into mild.

89
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.420
Surely I know that

90
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.420
this will be changed.

91
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.380
And if I go ahead and print this

92
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.100
again, the cutting dot

93
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.740
temperature and we'll put up

94
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.780
a message as well, just like this.

95
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.780
After changing looks good.

96
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.940
And I also want

97
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.100
to check one more thing.

98
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.380
Direct look into the class.

99
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.380
So you might have guessed already

100
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.900
what I'm trying to do in this case

101
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.340
I'm trying to directly access

102
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.580
the chai and the temperature here.

103
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.220
Fair enough.

104
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.860
What do you think will be

105
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.340
the values at line number

106
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.860
10 and line number 11?

107
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.340
Guess it.

108
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.220
It's actually good activity.

109
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.460
So what you're going to notice

110
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.900
in this one that if I go ahead

111
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.780
and check it after changing it

112
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.460
smiled, that's obviously and direct

113
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.700
look into the class, it's still hot.

114
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.660
We have seen that already.

115
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.100
We have had a quite

116
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.700
discussion on this one.

117
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.300
Now the only thing which changes

118
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.740
now let's just say I use a del,

119
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.940
which is a deletion operator and

120
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.180
I go ahead and say that

121
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.420
cuttingchai temperature now needs

122
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.340
to be deleted and now after

123
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.140
deleting it I want to check that

124
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.620
what's the value of this cutting

125
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.660
dot temperature?

126
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.580
That's interesting.

127
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.180
You have deleted that in line

128
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.220
number 13 and just after deleting

129
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.540
it you want to check it.

130
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.170
What could be the value?

131
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.450
Is it unknown?

132
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.010
Like is it none undefined?

133
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.010
Don't get the value, get the error

134
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.970
or we get still

135
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.130
the mild or we get the strong.

136
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.410
Lots of question and that's

137
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.089
what investigative study is.

138
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.890
And this is exactly the attribute

139
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.450
shadowing is if I go ahead and run

140
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.170
this, it still gets the heart.

141
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.970
So if somehow the reference

142
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.130
of this variable or the object

143
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.730
attribute is no longer available,

144
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.940
then it fall backs to the value

145
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.300
of the attribute which was

146
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.660
defined in the CHAI itself.

147
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.940
That's the interesting part.

148
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.060
Now let's go ahead and say that

149
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.700
if we don't have the temperature

150
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.100
or if we try to add some value

151
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.180
and we don't have this, here.

152
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.260
So for example, let's just say

153
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.300
in this cutting I go ahead and

154
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.660
say I have a cup and the cup

155
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.860
value is going to be small,

156
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.740
can I go ahead and print the

157
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.390
value?

158
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.190
Of course you can go ahead

159
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.470
and print the value.

160
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.990
Let's go ahead and duplicate this.

161
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.070
And we'll say not after

162
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.190
changing, we'll say cup size is.

163
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.230
And we will say this will be

164
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.510
directly cup surely doable.

165
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.950
Very, very doable.

166
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.070
If I go ahead and look

167
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.310
at this, cup size is small.

168
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.110
No problem there.

169
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.590
We got this value.

170
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.030
But what if I go ahead

171
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.510
and try to delete this one

172
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.050
very interesting case.

173
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.130
So if I go ahead and delete

174
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.370
the cup reference and now if I try

175
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.050
to just print the value, what

176
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.610
will happen in that case?

177
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.610
This time the value doesn't exist.

178
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.490
In the class.

179
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.490
Now this also gives

180
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.410
an interesting result.

181
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.610
You need to see this.

182
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.470
So notice here this time.

183
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.090
This is an attribute error.

184
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.290
The chai object has no attribute

185
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.650
because you injected that

186
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.930
attribute, but you actually

187
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.130
deleted that attribute.

188
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.490
So there's no fallback.

189
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.970
But if it happens that

190
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.430
the fallback is there in the chai,

191
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.470
it will get the value

192
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.950
the default fallback there.

193
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.670
And that's exactly the shadowing.

194
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.710
So if there is nothing

195
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.670
to fallback, the shadow will fall

196
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.150
onto the class itself.

197
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.910
If it doesn't exist in the class,

198
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.390
there is no fallback for it.

199
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.270
And that is it.

200
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.070
That is your attribute shadowing.

201
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.110
Hope you understood this.

202
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.670
Hope you got the concept clearly,

203
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.870
nicely, and please rate us.

204
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.310
Let's catch up in the next video.
