1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.400
All right, let's move on.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.000
And this one is a little bit

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of a complex problem.

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.760
But yes, we have to deal with

5
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.160
the complex problems as well.

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.320
The ability to handle

7
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.800
the complex problems will make

8
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.920
you a great developer.

9
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.240
Don't shy them away.

10
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.279
They look really, scary at first.

11
00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.320
But eventually you will

12
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.640
nail down much, much

13
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.840
greater problems than this.

14
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.600
So let's read this one by one.

15
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.160
The step one is always to read

16
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.440
the problem as closely as you can.

17
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.720
So notice here you can.

18
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.920
You are building a smart

19
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920
thermostat alert system.

20
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.480
Pretty good.

21
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.680
We are building a thermostat

22
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.960
alerting system.

23
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.120
And what do we want

24
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.000
to do in this, system?

25
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.840
Just read this pretty easy.

26
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.920
If the device status is active,

27
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.160
okay, so we have to measure

28
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.719
the device status first

29
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.560
and the temperature is above 35.

30
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.920
Then we have to put

31
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.320
up a warning sign that high

32
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.520
temperature alert, all right?

33
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.300
Else the temperature is normal.

34
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.740
If the device is off,

35
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.580
device is offline.

36
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.340
So notice here we are not checking

37
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.620
just for one condition, but we

38
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.820
are checking for one condition

39
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.500
and inside that also we are checking

40
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.660
for another condition.

41
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.940
And this is a kind

42
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.740
of a leveling of the condition.

43
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.780
As you can say.

44
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.180
This is also known as a nesting

45
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.180
of if statements.

46
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.980
But again, that doesn't really matter

47
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.820
or doesn't really sound much.

48
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.200
Now you have seen

49
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.080
the problem statement.

50
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.720
You can see, it makes sense.

51
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.080
I'm checking for one condition,

52
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.000
then inside that I'm checking for

53
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.600
further another condition.

54
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.080
And then only I'm putting

55
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480
up the warning message.

56
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760
Else part is pretty clear.

57
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.440
And we are checking for here.

58
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.840
So first let's see how we can

59
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.240
actually take down this problem.

60
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.320
So we'll close this one and we'll

61
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.840
create a new file and we'll

62
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.560
call this one as smart,

63
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.410
probably lowercase smart thermostat.

64
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.730
Py the first thing that we have

65
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.330
to measure is device status.

66
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.450
I don't know how that is coming

67
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.250
up, but as of now, let's assume that

68
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.530
the device status is active.

69
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.170
Now as the problem statement says, it

70
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.250
could be device status as active or

71
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.169
it could be as device is offline.

72
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.610
So that's good.

73
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.409
And I another thing that will come

74
00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.729
up here is notice here

75
00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.489
the temperature is 35, so we are

76
00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.329
checking this 35 only when

77
00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.369
the device status is active.

78
00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.249
So let's just say we

79
00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.129
create a variable.

80
00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.849
We call this one as temperature.

81
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:24.609
Temperature.

82
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.729
And the temperature is 38.

83
00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.329
Okay, so how do we write a program?

84
00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.209
We simply go ahead and say if

85
00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.889
the device status

86
00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.889
is equals to active.

87
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.390
If it is active, we simply go

88
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.110
ahead and Put some message.

89
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.830
And by the way, just for temporary

90
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.110
point, you want

91
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.270
to write the else part first.

92
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.310
There is a nice trick

93
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.870
in these kinds of statements.

94
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.470
You can write a keyword as pass.

95
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.630
Pass simply means I

96
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.430
will come back here.

97
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.830
We'll do about it later on.

98
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.390
Right now just ignore this so that

99
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.110
you don't give me any warning.

100
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.590
I come back here and I write

101
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.270
the else part here and else part.

102
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.480
The writing of the else part is easy.

103
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.840
If the device status is active,

104
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000
we are doing something else.

105
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.560
If the device is off, we are

106
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.400
saying device is offline.

107
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.520
So here I can simply go

108
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720
ahead and print a statement

109
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.000
that says like this.

110
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.960
And we simply call this

111
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.400
one as device is offline.

112
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.730
So I hope you can see,

113
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.160
the keyword pass helped me

114
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.440
to write the else part first.

115
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.600
Without giving me any warning.

116
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.840
If I just go ahead and remove

117
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.360
this and write it like this,

118
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.960
it always keeps me yelling

119
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.320
give me that squiggly line.

120
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.740
So I don't like them.

121
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.340
So I sometimes temporarily write

122
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.500
these kinds of code just because

123
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.100
I want to come back here later.

124
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.900
Now notice here it says

125
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.060
okay, device is active.

126
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580
If we go into this part, then we

127
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.860
simply check for the temperature.

128
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.540
If it is above 35, we put a warning.

129
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.340
Otherwise we say

130
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.860
temperature is normal.

131
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.460
So inside this we can again

132
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.300
start if condition here or

133
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.420
conditional block and we can check

134
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.580
for temperature here.

135
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.300
Now temperature.

136
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.980
If it is greater than 35, we simply

137
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.860
go ahead and say some message.

138
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.700
So I'll just go ahead and print

139
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.660
a simple statement,

140
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.020
high temperature alert.

141
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.340
And if it is an alert, it should end

142
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.740
with an exclamation.

143
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.980
And here also I can put

144
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.900
up an else part.

145
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.140
And this is the most interesting

146
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.500
and point where you should

147
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.540
pay a little attention.

148
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.180
So I'll just go ahead and print this

149
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.540
and I will first say

150
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.000
temperature is normal.

151
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.480
So the most important part here is.

152
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.600
Notice here we have two

153
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.560
else's here, but each one is

154
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.120
denoted inside a block.

155
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.720
The block is the most important

156
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400
part that we are studying here.

157
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.000
This is the outer block.

158
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440
The else part here is

159
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.040
of the outer if.

160
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.440
But here we can see this is

161
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.920
if statement and the if

162
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.880
can be easily found out.

163
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.520
The else part with the indentation.

164
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.720
Now here the else part is

165
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.760
actually totally optional.

166
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.680
We could have it.

167
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.160
We couldn't have it.

168
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.760
Doesn't really bother us much.

169
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.720
We can have it.

170
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.240
We might ignore it,

171
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520
but in this case we have it.

172
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.800
Our problem statement says

173
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.160
that we need to have it.

174
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.840
But again, pay small attention

175
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.640
on the indentation

176
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.840
and how the leveling.

177
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.160
And again there is nothing which

178
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.800
is stopping you to start another

179
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.080
block inside the if statement.

180
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.800
Maybe after printing a message

181
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.240
you want to start another condition

182
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440
here, so you can go ahead

183
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.860
and start another condition.

184
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.330
So so let's just say I will simply

185
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.050
write it as true and then I want

186
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.170
to write another print statement.

187
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.330
I can just go ahead and write

188
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.050
that I will not do it here.

189
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.530
This was just to explain you,

190
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.130
but get the point that yes,

191
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.770
