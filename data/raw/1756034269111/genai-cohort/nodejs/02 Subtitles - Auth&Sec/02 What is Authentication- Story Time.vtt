1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
All right, so in this

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.000
particular video, I have a story

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.040
for you now, Piyush.

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.880
But we were here

5
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.119
to understand authentication.

6
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.600
Why there is a story.

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.640
You know what happens?

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.640
I am a kind of person

9
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.640
who don't, likes to understand

10
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.400
things by just coding, right?

11
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
We should understand

12
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.760
what we are coding.

13
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.480
The, what is the logic behind it?

14
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.840
What is it, how that

15
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.520
idea was invented.

16
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.240
Okay?

17
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120
Because coding is the simplest

18
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.040
thing and at the end

19
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.080
thing that we have to do.

20
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.380
So let's understand

21
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.220
the authentication.

22
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.420
Now there was one more story

23
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.220
that I have just shadcn

24
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.820
with you that was XYZ College.

25
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
So this particular thing, I think

26
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.780
this particular story or this

27
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.220
particular visual representation

28
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.740
helped you in understanding what

29
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.900
authentication and authorization is.

30
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.620
Now let's understand authentication.

31
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500
Little bit in deep and some

32
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.380
challenges that might occur.

33
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.420
Okay?

34
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.100
Now see there, this is

35
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.150
a story of a parking lot.

36
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.110
So let's say that this

37
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.550
particular area, this particular

38
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.830
is a parking lot.

39
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.190
So what is a parking lot?

40
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.110
Parking lot is an empty big space

41
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.110
where a lot of a lot of vehicles

42
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.790
can come and park themselves.

43
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.190
Right.

44
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.510
Now technically this parking lot is

45
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.590
let's say a paid service, okay.

46
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.430
Or a private owned service

47
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.830
by some kind of mall.

48
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.710
And you don't want that anyone can

49
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070
come and park in this parking lot.

50
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.990
So what will you do?

51
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.230
You will basically hire

52
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.305
a security guard.

53
00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:23.330
So, so let's say that this

54
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.290
is the gate and this

55
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.610
is your security guard.

56
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.450
Or I can say the valet parking.

57
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.410
So you have, basically you

58
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.890
have a security guard here.

59
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.650
So if anyone wants to park a car,

60
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.650
no one has access to here, right?

61
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.210
What you have to do is let's say

62
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.010
this is the person with his car.

63
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.370
So let me just try

64
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.450
to draw a very basic car.

65
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.690
So a green color car.

66
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.570
I don't know why I came

67
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.650
up with green color.

68
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.690
But I think yeah, this is okay.

69
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.890
Okay, so one more thing

70
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.250
I'll just try to do.

71
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.450
So let's say that this is your car.

72
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.890
Okay?

73
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.530
I didn't know that.

74
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.410
I am such a good artist, but yeah.

75
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.850
Now let's say this is a car, okay?

76
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.530
And this is the owner of the car.

77
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.810
Now this owner of the car wants

78
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.090
to park his car in this parking lot.

79
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.650
So what will happen is he will come

80
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.770
to the security

81
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.169
guard and he will say that, hey,

82
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.770
can you please park my car?

83
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.090
Security guard will say that,

84
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.530
okay, there is a space available.

85
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.070
I'll park your car.

86
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.910
So let's say that the number of this

87
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.470
particular car, okay, let's give

88
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.910
it a number, was, let's say

89
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.710
something like, you know, X, X1, Y

90
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.550
so this was the number of the car.

91
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.990
So what this particular

92
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.110
guy will do is he will park his car.

93
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.550
Okay?

94
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.070
So his car is parked.

95
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.430
Now, in return, he needs some

96
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.630
kind of receipt, right?

97
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.470
He needs some kind of token, right,

98
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.870
that, hey, you parked my car.

99
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.270
But when I will come back, how

100
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.050
can I tell you which was my car?

101
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.410
Because if we just say him

102
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.570
tell me your number, he might

103
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.930
say any other number.

104
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.370
Imagine coming in Honda City

105
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.690
and going back in Mercedes.

106
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.210
That's not a right thing, right?

107
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.330
So what this security

108
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.250
guard can do is security guard can

109
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.450
basically give him a number.

110
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.769
So let's say security guard

111
00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.490
said, hey, here is your token.

112
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.290
Basically a token.

113
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.250
Let's say a number is written even.

114
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.330
Okay, I'm just taking

115
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.050
a random example of E1.

116
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.490
So what now this, this

117
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.810
particular person can do is.

118
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
But this particular person

119
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720
can maintain a diary.

120
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.600
Okay, typical.

121
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.240
How happens he can maintain a diary.

122
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.920
Okay, so let's say this is the diary.

123
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.600
And in this diary he can

124
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.960
make an entry that E1 token

125
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960
belongs to XX1Y car.

126
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.840
Okay?

127
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.120
Now this person can go roam around,

128
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.720
you know, he can go to shopping,

129
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.360
he can basically enjoy himself.

130
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.320
And when he comes back, what happens?

131
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.640
He has to give his token back.

132
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.360
That, hey, here is my token,

133
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.680
E1 that you gave me.

134
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.280
Can you give me my car?

135
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.520
And then security guard will

136
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.600
say, okay, let me check.

137
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.040
He will open his diary.

138
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.800
He will see E1 was this car.

139
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.240
So he will, he will take

140
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.480
the token back, give him his car,

141
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.000
and delete his entry.

142
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.240
Is this flow clear?

143
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.680
Typically how this basically

144
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.800
happens in the real world.

145
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.560
Also, whenever you go, you give

146
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.880
your car, you get a, token

147
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.720
which uniquely identifies your car.

148
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.640
Some kind of number you get, right?

149
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.000
So let's say this is one.

150
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400
Let's say more users are coming.

151
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.000
Okay, so.

152
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.120
So one more user is there.

153
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.960
One more user is there.

154
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.120
One more user is there.

155
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.320
So what is happening is you are

156
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.440
getting different, different tokens.

157
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960
So everyone is getting a token.

158
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960
So let's say E3, E4.

159
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.280
And now we have a lot

160
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.760
of cars in the parking lot.

161
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.640
So these are the cars parked.

162
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.680
And let me just, quickly rename

163
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.880
their, you know, numbers.

164
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.040
So let's say this is E2,

165
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.360
this is, you know, this is

166
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.760
the three three number.

167
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.280
And this car has a number of four.

168
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760
Okay, now what happens?

169
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.780
You have four entries in your,

170
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.540
in your book, in your,

171
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.020
diary, whatever you are maintaining.

172
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.580
So E2 is there, right?

173
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.140
Which is having

174
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.660
a number, let's say E2Y.

175
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.620
Then you have so on.

176
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.900
So you got the point.

177
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.340
Now tell me just one thing.

178
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.420
I just want to understand from you,

179
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.420
okay, how open minded you are.

180
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.260
Do you see any problem here

181
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.220
with this approach?

182
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.540
Everything is working fine.

183
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.100
Everything is secure, right?

184
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100
There is no problem at all.

185
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.140
Everything is secure.

186
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.780
We are doing every kind of check.

187
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.180
We are maintaining a diary,

188
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.820
and our security guard is

189
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.140
working really nice, okay?

190
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.650
He is a very hardworking man.

191
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.250
But what problem could come here?

192
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.930
Can you think of a problem here?

193
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.810
Okay, now let me come back

194
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.730
with the problem.

195
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.370
Number one.

196
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.970
What happens if there

197
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.250
is a sale in the mall?

198
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.970
Let's say there's a lot of rush,

199
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.730
a lot of people came in.

200
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.290
You know, on a typical day, there

201
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.010
were just 30, 40, users or members

202
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.050
or, you know, users, coming in.

203
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.450
But some day 200 came in.

204
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.250
So what will happen?

205
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.500
This security guard will

206
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.820
be overwhelmed because

207
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.660
now he has to do 200.

208
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.260
Now, because you just had one

209
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.420
security guard, what you have

210
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.380
to do is he has to do one by one.

211
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.020
Number one, he's tired, okay?

212
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.900
He is tired.

213
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.180
That means he can basically,

214
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.220
you know, get a heart attack

215
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.740
or he can collapse, right?

216
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.220
So technically, there's a lot

217
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.860
of stress on one person.

218
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.100
Secondly, he has to do one by one.

219
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.340
So that means if someday 200

220
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.060
people came in, they have

221
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.270
to wait in a long queue because

222
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.790
you only had one resource.

223
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.270
See, there is a thing that

224
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.590
your parking lot can

225
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.830
support 200 cars, okay?

226
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.390
That is fine.

227
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.670
You have enough space.

228
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.310
But because you just had one

229
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.230
security guard, now he, now there is

230
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.470
a long queue of people, which

231
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.870
is not a good experience, right?

232
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.870
Because he is doing one

233
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.350
by one, one by one.

234
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.950
And so how can you

235
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.510
solve this problem?

236
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.230
You will say, push.

237
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.910
It's very simple.

238
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.670
What I can do is I can basically

239
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.230
have three security guards.

240
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.750
You will say that because

241
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.830
too many people are coming.

242
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.710
So what I will do is

243
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.710
I'll make three lines.

244
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.350
Okay, so one, two, and one more.

245
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.110
Security guard.

246
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.430
I said, very good.

247
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.950
This is a good optimization.

248
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.670
Now you have divided the traffic

249
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.550
into three lines.

250
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.510
And what is happening is you

251
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.830
are basically processing

252
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.550
three cars concurrently, correct?

253
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.550
Parallelly, I would say.

254
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.270
Parallelly, you are

255
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.830
processing three cars, okay?

256
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.550
So now your processing

257
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.390
speed is faster.

258
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.910
But now there is a problem

259
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.980
because there is only one diary.

260
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.660
Because there is only one diary.

261
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.180
When this person is writing

262
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.140
to this diary, can this person

263
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.460
also write to the diary?

264
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.780
No.

265
00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.020
Right?

266
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.780
Because there is only one diary.

267
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.260
So technically, what happened?

268
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.060
Even if you have three security

269
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.940
guards, or even if you have four

270
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.860
security guards, the major problem

271
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.260
still remains that at a time

272
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.820
you can only process one car.

273
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.700
Because if this Person is busy

274
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.580
entering some entry here.

275
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.060
These three are waiting for

276
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.620
the notebook to get freedom, right?

277
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.020
So still you are only processing

278
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.260
one notebook at a time.

279
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.100
The only thing is

280
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.870
that the stress per.

281
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.420
What do you say?

282
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.460
That the per security

283
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.060
guard is reduced.

284
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.780
But still the line is very long.

285
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.499
So you will say, okay, no problem.

286
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:37.940
To solve this particular problem,

287
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.460
let's have four diaries.

288
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.940
No.

289
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.140
Hey, you have your own

290
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.100
independent diary.

291
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.740
You have your own independent diary.

292
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.460
You have your own independent diary.

293
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.580
And you also have your

294
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.010
own independent diary.

295
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.250
Now there is no one shadcn diary.

296
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.170
I said okay, which is very nice.

297
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.650
Right?

298
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.890
Now they are not dependent

299
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.890
on each other.

300
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.970
So what happens is he

301
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:56.970
can keep on entering.

302
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.410
So this particular guy can keep

303
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.450
on entering stuff here.

304
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.450
This particular can keep

305
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.290
on entering stuff here.

306
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.730
This here, and this here.

307
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.370
Now you have solved all

308
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.850
the problems very nicely.

309
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.050
I mean, you are processing

310
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.250
four cars parallelly,

311
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.650
which is like four times.

312
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.450
And no one is dependent

313
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.090
on each other, which is nice.

314
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.050
Now here comes a problem.

315
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.570
Let's say this person, when came for

316
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.050
parking, he gave to this guy, okay?

317
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.050
So that means the entry for

318
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.450
E2 is in this particular diary.

319
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.050
Now what happens when he

320
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.849
comes back to take his car?

321
00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:31.410
He accidentally comes here

322
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.929
to this guy, he will say,

323
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.250
hey, My token is E2.

324
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.289
Can you give me my car?

325
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.330
Is there any E2 entry

326
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.929
in this particular diary?

327
00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:40.849
No, right?

328
00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:41.568
Because that.

329
00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:43.409
That entry is here.

330
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.729
So technically this person

331
00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:46.169
will say, sorry, bro, I

332
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:47.169
don't know who are you.

333
00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:49.569
I don't have any entry for E2.

334
00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:52.369
So I cannot process your request.

335
00:08:52.369 --> 00:08:53.969
I cannot validate whether

336
00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:55.489
your car, which is your car.

337
00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:59.009
So that means this guy

338
00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.169
has to remember that.

339
00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:03.289
Hey, when you came for parking,

340
00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:04.609
you have given to this security

341
00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:05.809
guard, security guard number.

342
00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:06.849
Let's say four.

343
00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:08.369
So when taking back the car,

344
00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:10.210
you have to come to four.

345
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.450
You cannot go to E1, you cannot go

346
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.090
to security guard one, two or three.

347
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.410
You have to come back to the same

348
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.090
person, which is a problem, right?

349
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.690
He has to remember something.

350
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.850
And tell me just one thing,

351
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.930
what happens?

352
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.570
Okay, if everyone parked their car

353
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.010
with person four,

354
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.930
now these three are sitting idle.

355
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.010
Because everyone parked

356
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.770
their car to number four.

357
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.050
While taking back, also

358
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.170
they have to come to four.

359
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.880
So that means four is always

360
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.080
under stress, right?

361
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.136
For some reasons, 1,

362
00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:42.160
2 and 3 are busy.

363
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.240
Plus people have to remember that.

364
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.520
Hey, if I have given my car

365
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.320
to person number four, I have

366
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.680
to take back from him.

367
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.720
So this is a big problem, right?

368
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.640
You're trying to understand

369
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.399
the problem, right?

370
00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.320
See, we are not talking

371
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.000
about authentication.

372
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.560
We are not talking

373
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.160
about authorization.

374
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.480
I'm just telling you a story.

375
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.080
Everything will

376
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080
eventually make sense.

377
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.040
Now, how will you solve

378
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.840
this particular problem?

379
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.320
So, problem came that when you

380
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.000
distributed their diaries, okay?

381
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.440
When you distribute their diaries,

382
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.800
now you have to remember which

383
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.070
person is having which thing.

384
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.540
So this is basically what happened.

385
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.740
What I'm trying to tell you is

386
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.380
that initially, when you just

387
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.740
had one security guard, okay?

388
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.900
Let's note down our observations.

389
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.500
When you had one security

390
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.260
guard, okay, security guard, or

391
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.139
I could say the park person.

392
00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:27.260
You had only one diary, okay?

393
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Only one diary.

394
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.780
And what you were doing is you were

395
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.180
basically giving them tokens.

396
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.500
You were giving them tokens

397
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.180
and everything was good.

398
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.960
The pros were okay.

399
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.640
The pros were number one because

400
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.240
there was only one security guard.

401
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.520
No need to remember.

402
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.440
No need to remember.

403
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.240
Okay?

404
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.520
Which guard parked your car?

405
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.240
Which is nice.

406
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.080
You can just come back, okay?

407
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.810
Secondly, the problem was,

408
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.080
secondly, the cons, okay?

409
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.960
Con was, okay?

410
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.560
The problem was that there was only.

411
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.400
Only one guard, okay?

412
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.520
So speed was very slow.

413
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.440
So speed was a problem.

414
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.710
Speed was slow, okay?

415
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.430
Plus a lot of stress.

416
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.070
Only on one person.

417
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.830
Only on one person, okay?

418
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.310
And, so, yeah, this.

419
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.670
This was basically what was happening

420
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.270
in the first scenario, right?

421
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.150
Nice.

422
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.910
Then to solve the cons

423
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.350
of this particular thing, what it

424
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.150
did do, you basically had the.

425
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.510
Another architect that, hey,

426
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.150
I will have four security guards

427
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.240
but only one diary, okay?

428
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.520
So the pro was, okay,

429
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.480
what did you solve?

430
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.440
You basically solved

431
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.760
this problem, okay?

432
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.040
You solved this particular problem.

433
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.520
So I'll just say, hey,

434
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.080
this particular approach solved

435
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.000
this particular problem.

436
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.240
A lot of stress, okay?

437
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.960
But still, there was one con.

438
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.600
What?

439
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.480
That at a, given.

440
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.950
At a, given time, only one

441
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.150
person has access to diary.

442
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.550
So which basically

443
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.190
makes it still slow.

444
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.630
Got it.

445
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.950
Now, because, if one person is

446
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.590
writing to a diary, the all

447
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.030
others cannot write to it.

448
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.470
Okay?

449
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.790
This was your approach too.

450
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.550
See, this was your approach.

451
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.990
One, you got the problem.

452
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.630
Okay?

453
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.870
So you solved it, but you

454
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.030
got another problem.

455
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.190
So to solve this particular

456
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.110
problem, what did you do?

457
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.230
You basically said, okay,

458
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.030
I'll just do one thing.

459
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.030
Four security guards.

460
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.110
That means four diaries

461
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.380
must be there, okay?

462
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.660
That means four diaries.

463
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.380
Everyone has their, independent IDs.

464
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.020
Now, if I talk about the pros

465
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.300
of this thing, what did you solve?

466
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.980
You basically solved this

467
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.700
particular problem.

468
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.780
You solved this particular

469
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.900
problem, which is nice.

470
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.420
See, at every step, you are solving

471
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.940
one problem at a time, right?

472
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.420
So solved this particular problem

473
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.820
that at a given point of time,

474
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.820
only one person has the access.

475
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.740
But now you introduce one more con.

476
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.420
Now you introduce one more con.

477
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.760
What was the con?

478
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.880
The con was that hey, the you

479
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.480
know, the Parkers, or I can say

480
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.240
the customers have to remember,

481
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.360
have to remember which was

482
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.800
the guard while parking, okay?

483
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.960
Because you have to go

484
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.600
to the same person in which your

485
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.800
diary was maintained, right?

486
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.840
In which, in which your car's

487
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.700
diary is maintained or in which

488
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.340
diary or cars entries maintain.

489
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.500
You have to go to the same person.

490
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.500
Because if you go to some

491
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.220
other person in his diary, there

492
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.340
is no entry for your car.

493
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.180
So that's a problem.

494
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.060
Now technically, if you see

495
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.900
about authentication, what we

496
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.820
are going to do is now we are

497
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.140
going to first implement this

498
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.500
kind of authentication.

499
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.100
One server, one state, okay?

500
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.580
Diaries basically state.

501
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.660
And we are going to end

502
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.740
up in this problem.

503
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.820
Then we are going to solve

504
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.900
this problem and I'll show

505
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.740
you the another problem.

506
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.300
Then I'll going to say that hey, how

507
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.660
horizontally scaling is a problem.

508
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.240
But in this particular video I

509
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.960
just wanted you to visualize

510
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.000
what is happening as per your life.

511
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.760
Okay?

512
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.240
So in the next video, let's go ahead

513
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.240
and code this stuff,

514
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.240
code this stuff and code this

515
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.800
stuff and then finally solve all

516
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.640
the problems in just one go.

517
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.120
Okay?

518
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.320
So that is the thing.

519
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.600
So I hope that you have understood

520
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.960
the story and the problem behind it.

521
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.200
Now how to relate it

522
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.040
with the authentication.

523
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.400
That's my problem that we are going

524
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.520
to see in the next video.
