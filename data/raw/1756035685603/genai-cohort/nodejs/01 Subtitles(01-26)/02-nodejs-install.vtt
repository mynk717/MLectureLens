00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.960
So hey guys, welcome to the second

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.680
video on Node J series.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.760
And in this particular video

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.400
I'll walk you through how you can

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.680
install Node js on your machine.

6
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.840
So it's very simple.

7
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
What you have to do is you have

8
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.200
to go to this website that is

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.720
nodejs.org so this is the official

10
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.920
website from no of Node js.

11
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.160
And here what you can see is,

12
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.280
you can see this big button

13
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.800
that is download Node js lts.

14
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.560
Now what is this?

15
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.640
LTS means LTS here means

16
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.840
long term support.

17
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.120
That means it's a stable

18
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.560
version of Node js.

19
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560
So there are two versions of Node js.

20
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.720
So let me just search if you

21
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.880
have this download button here.

22
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.200
So you can see that you have this

23
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080
LTS and you have a current versions.

24
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.600
So what happens is that how the Node

25
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.400
js team basically develops is.

26
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.680
So if you can see that this

27
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.800
is your LTS version,

28
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.560
basically the stable version.

29
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.400
And currently the team of Node js

30
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.120
is working on this feature, this

31
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.640
particular version that is 23.

32
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.600
So this is the current version.

33
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.560
This current feature has a lot

34
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.800
of more features which are

35
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.960
upcoming, but they are not stable.

36
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.120
They are not recommended to use

37
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.519
on the machine,

38
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.480
on the production machine, right?

39
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.000
I mean if you want to play around

40
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.039
with these things, with the new

41
00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.000
features you can go with

42
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.480
current, but they are not stable.

43
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.840
So there can be bugs, there

44
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.000
can be crashes and definitely

45
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.920
not recommended for

46
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320
the production use case.

47
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.160
So LTS is a long term support.

48
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040
Now what will happen is once the team

49
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.670
finishes this, once the team

50
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.270
develops all the features,

51
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.910
they are going to Release a version

52
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.030
24 that is going to be an LTS.

53
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.230
So all the features developed

54
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.790
in 23 will be moved to 24.

55
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.070
One interesting thing is that

56
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.910
all the even versions are

57
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.670
always lts and all the odd

58
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.869
versions are something that,

59
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.630
that teams are working on.

60
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.270
So we have to go with this LTS

61
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.830
version and you can select your

62
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.470
platform, Mac OS is there, Linux

63
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.190
is there and Windows is there.

64
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.790
So you can select and using,

65
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.630
you can just say NVM Docker.

66
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.710
So NVM is fine.

67
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.240
Okay, so what you can do is

68
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.320
you can use this also or

69
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.560
it's a package manager.

70
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.600
Or what you can do is you can

71
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
just download it from here.

72
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.560
So I would recommend to go

73
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.240
with this pre built installer.

74
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.200
So select the version

75
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.920
22 or any LTS version.

76
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.640
Okay.

77
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.120
Because you might be watching

78
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.199
this video in future

79
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.960
when There is version 24.

80
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.000
Just make sure that you

81
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.560
are on an LTS version.

82
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.200
Select your operating system

83
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.760
and which, like which,

84
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400
what do you Call which architecture

85
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.300
you are using

86
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.660
and just click on this download.

87
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.020
Now once you download the setup, what

88
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.540
will happen is you will be prompted

89
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.820
with like, you know, next, next,

90
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.300
next, agree and all that stuff.

91
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.820
And node js will be installed

92
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.700
on your machine.

93
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.900
I won't be doing this step

94
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.260
because I already have node js

95
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.780
installed on my machine.

96
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.900
Now once you have done all this

97
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.580
process, let's verify that if you

98
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.420
have node js installed or not.

99
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.820
So first command is if you say node

100
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.380
version, you can see

101
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.160
that I'm getting v.22.11.0.

102
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.440
That means my node

103
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.000
version is 22.1 1.0.

104
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.760
If you are getting 24 or if you are

105
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.680
getting any number that's fine.

106
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.000
But if you are getting any error,

107
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.480
that is where you might have

108
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.720
messed up with the installation

109
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.920
and you might want to re

110
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.200
verify that what went wrong.

111
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.440
Okay, But I'm sure 99% in the chances

112
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080
you will be right, you will

113
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.640
be able to install this thing.

114
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.160
There is only just 1% chance.

115
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.290
And even, even if it is not working,

116
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.370
try restarting your machine

117
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.850
because sometimes, you know,

118
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.090
things do work after the restart.

119
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.650
One more thing is that when you

120
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.570
install node you can just do an npm.

121
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.330
So there is a tool npm,

122
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.850
which unofficially stands

123
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.450
for Node Package Manager.

124
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.610
So this comes automatically

125
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.170
when you install node js.

126
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.050
So you can see that I

127
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.410
have npm version 10.

128
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.610
So we are going to use this npm

129
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.490
Unofficial Full Form Node Package

130
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.850
Manager to, to create, manage,

131
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.010
install external dependencies.

132
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.170
So let's say I want to install

133
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.370
some extra package, I want

134
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.250
to install some extra

135
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.210
dependency so I can use npm.

136
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.770
Or maybe I want to create my

137
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.610
own packages so I can use npm.

138
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.570
Okay, this comes along

139
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.530
with the node js.

140
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.290
So when you install this node js,

141
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.450
this automatically installs npm.

142
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.090
So you can see here it says node

143
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.810
js includes npm this thing.

144
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.970
So this is by default shipped

145
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.250
along with the node js only.

146
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.600
So if you are getting these numbers,

147
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.240
congratulation guys, you have

148
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.000
successfully installed node js.

149
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.040
One thing you can do is you

150
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.640
can just say node and you can

151
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.000
play around with the Node js.

152
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So you can write any JavaScript code

153
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.320
and to exit out just say Ctrl D.

154
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.600
So Control D, that is Ctrl D is going

155
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.640
to exit out this particular repl.

156
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.960
Okay, so with node it basically gives

157
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.360
you a console where you can play

158
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.800
around with the Node js where

159
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.280
you can write any JavaScript code

160
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.960
and that executes like a charm.
