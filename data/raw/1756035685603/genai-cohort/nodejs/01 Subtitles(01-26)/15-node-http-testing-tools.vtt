00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey guys, welcome back

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.320
to another exciting video.

3
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.360
And in this video I'm going

4
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.560
to show you that how we can use

5
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.680
these API testing clients and tools

6
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.880
in order to build

7
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.960
a very reliable and great APIs.

8
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.640
Okay, so these testing tools

9
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.880
are very, very important

10
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.560
to build an API and they are very

11
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.080
helpful while you're developing.

12
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.760
So there are a lot

13
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.840
of API testing tools.

14
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.600
And don't worry, I'll tell

15
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.760
you that what these does.

16
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.320
So like you have the Postman.

17
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960
This is the like most famous one.

18
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.130
And I have used the Postman a lot.

19
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.450
But the only problem with them is

20
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.450
that now there is a lot of features

21
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.010
in Postman which you don't need.

22
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.930
So they have made this particular

23
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.290
product a lot bloated.

24
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.010
Okay, so this is a very bloated

25
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.650
product and it requires

26
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.130
you a sign in and all that.

27
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.050
So it was a great

28
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.969
product, I would say.

29
00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.050
And it is still a great

30
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.210
product, no doubt in that.

31
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.090
But the only problem

32
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.010
is it's very heavy.

33
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.650
Now then there is a,

34
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.050
alternative that is Isomnia.

35
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.330
Again it was also a great

36
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.490
product, but now it is

37
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.080
very, very, very heavy.

38
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.280
So I don't prefer to use it

39
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.240
or something like that.

40
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.920
And these are not open source.

41
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.080
I mean Isomnia is open source.

42
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.160
But my personal favorite that I

43
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440
want to show you is one Bruno.

44
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.200
Okay, so Bruno is open source.

45
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.520
Great.

46
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.480
And next is thunderclient.

47
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.840
My personal favorite one is

48
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.680
thunderclient because this is

49
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680
not a standalone application.

50
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.720
This is a VS code extension

51
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480
which directly gives you

52
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.690
this UI in the VS code.

53
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.770
So this particular thing

54
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.250
is a game changer.

55
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.690
So what we are going to do is

56
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.370
in my Extensions tab, let's

57
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.290
search for Thunder client.

58
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.650
Okay, so you can see that we

59
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.970
have this Thunder client and I

60
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.090
can just do an installation.

61
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.410
Okay, so let's install thunderclient.

62
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.850
And done.

63
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.250
You can see that there is a new logo.

64
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.610
Now these Thunder clients can

65
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.690
help you, these API clients can

66
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.330
help you to test your APIs.

67
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.010
How what you have to do is you have

68
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.540
to click on this new request.

69
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.260
Cool.

70
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.420
From where do you want

71
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.180
to make the request?

72
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.300
So HTTP.

73
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.660
Hey.

74
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.580
HTTP.

75
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.580
Colon, colon, localhost.

76
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.100
Right on 8000.

77
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.420
Right on 8000.

78
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.820
I want to make a request.

79
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.300
What kind of request

80
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.980
you want to make?

81
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.780
I want to make a get request.

82
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.740
So you have get, post, put delete,

83
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.620
patch, head options and all.

84
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.660
Okay, so I want to make

85
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.740
a get request and I do.

86
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.660
Do you want to send any

87
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660
headers to the backend?

88
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.180
Yeah, I just want

89
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.940
to send two headers.

90
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.510
That's it.

91
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.390
And sent.

92
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.830
So what happens when you send, See

93
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.630
your server got a request and this

94
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.270
is what you get as a response.

95
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.710
So you got 200 as a response, 8 byte

96
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.510
size, 7 milliseconds it took

97
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.910
and your server sent three headers.

98
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.710
Nice.

99
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.990
Let's make a post request.

100
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.470
Okay, so you can make a post request.

101
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.350
So you can see that it's

102
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.350
an incoming request.

103
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590
Let's make a request at slash contact

104
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.750
us and do a send contact me

105
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.150
at this you're getting a 200.

106
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.710
So you can see that I can do all

107
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.610
the testing the that how my APIs

108
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.850
are working using this tool.

109
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.770
Okay, you can add headers, you can

110
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.930
add authorization, you can add body

111
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.690
here if you want to send something.

112
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.290
So everything is available here

113
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.530
and it also creates

114
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.530
a history of everything.

115
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.130
So I mean too good.

116
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.410
Okay, so this is what

117
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.130
we are going to use.

118
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.210
That is Thunder Client.

119
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.650
No installation, no overhead.

120
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.130
But please feel free to use

121
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.330
Postman if you want to.

122
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.530
It is same only if you will see

123
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.930
that if you will install Postman.

124
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.450
So here is where you

125
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.330
can give the URL.

126
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.330
You can select the method,

127
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.590
you can just click on this.

128
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.390
You know there is a send

129
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.470
button on the top which

130
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.430
they have not rendered.

131
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.350
You can do send.

132
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.190
So this is the data that

133
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.790
you are sending and you

134
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.630
will get the response.

135
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.030
So yeah, you can use Postman.

136
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.510
But yeah, for me it is little

137
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.230
bit bloated now and I prefer

138
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.350
Thunder Client over it.

139
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.910
Okay.
