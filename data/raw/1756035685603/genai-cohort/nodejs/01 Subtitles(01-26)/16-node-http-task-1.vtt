00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.920
So hello guys, in this

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.920
particular video, let's create

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.440
a very simple project.

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.560
So here I have created

5
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.360
a task MD file.

6
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.760
You will get these files.

7
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.560
So we have couple of tasks here.

8
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.600
You can read the task

9
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.680
that what we have to do.

10
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.640
And let's try to implement

11
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.600
all of these tasks and try

12
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.880
to code a server.

13
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.440
Okay, so again, boilerplate code.

14
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.320
So let's have an index js file

15
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.320
and let's have npm any typhoon y

16
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.730
so that we have, we have

17
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.810
the package or JSON file, right?

18
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.330
So inside the package JSON.

19
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
So what I'll do is I'll just say npm

20
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.610
install at the rate types/ node.

21
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.930
So let's wait for it.

22
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.210
And also let's configure

23
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.410
the start script to say

24
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.330
node hyphen hyphen Var.

25
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.170
And that is index js.

26
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.890
Cool stuff.

27
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.770
Right now inside my index js.

28
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.130
So what, what is my task?

29
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.330
Right, let's go on to task.

30
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.450
So my task is very simple.

31
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.500
So we have these four routes

32
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.380
that we have to make.

33
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.100
Routes or path is same thing.

34
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.500
So if there is a get request

35
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.780
on slash, we have to send

36
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.940
a simple hello message.

37
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.100
If there is a get request

38
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.180
on slash, contact us.

39
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.220
We have to do this.

40
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.540
If there's a post request

41
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.940
on slash tweet we have to do this.

42
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.100
If there's a get request

43
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.420
on this thing, we have to do this.

44
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.340
And also we need to store all

45
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.420
the incoming requests with

46
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.940
the timestamps to a log TXT file.

47
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.060
Wow, amazing.

48
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.700
So const HTTP equals request require

49
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.500
and let's have the node

50
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.180
HTTP module, you know, imported.

51
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.020
Then you can create a server using

52
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.980
this HTTP create server function

53
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.540
which takes a callback function.

54
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.060
So you have access to request,

55
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.740
you have response, and that's it.

56
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.380
Finally, server.

57
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.940
Hey server, can you please listen

58
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.860
on port number 8,000?

59
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900
And once you do that, once you are

60
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.580
successfully able to bind yourself

61
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.420
to that port, give me a console

62
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.680
log message saying that that HTTP

63
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.080
server, is running on port 8000.

64
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.160
Cool stuff, right?

65
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.560
So let's just do an npm start.

66
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.400
So you can see that my

67
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.240
server is running.

68
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480
So first things first, right?

69
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360
So if you go on to the tasks,

70
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.640
okay, so first is that you

71
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640
have to make a get route.

72
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.960
Send a simple hello message

73
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.600
from the server.

74
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
Okay, so what I can do is I can

75
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.880
say, hey, const the method, okay?

76
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.040
So I can just say request

77
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.000
method, okay?

78
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.930
And you can have the path,

79
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.890
okay, that is request path.

80
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.250
So I'm just getting request, URL.

81
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.850
Sorry.

82
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.210
So these are the two variables.

83
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.730
So let's have A switch case

84
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.850
on the path.

85
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.090
Okay.

86
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.570
And on the path, let's have

87
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.890
the first one that is case.

88
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.289
Okay.

89
00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.490
Case slash.

90
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.850
In this particular scenario,

91
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.970
what do we have to do?

92
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.530
So we have to send a simple

93
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.770
hello message from the server.

94
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.210
Pretty simple, right?

95
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.010
So you can just say

96
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.210
response dot, write head.

97
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.690
Okay?

98
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.310
Write head head that is 200

99
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.870
dot and you can just

100
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.910
end it saying hello.

101
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.310
Okay.

102
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.990
You can just send it saying hello

103
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.870
from the server.

104
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.750
Okay.

105
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.390
And even you can add an emoji

106
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.550
of saying, you know, hello

107
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.670
or something like that.

108
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.150
So yeah, emojis are cool, right?

109
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.550
So let's have an emoji.

110
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.830
So my first task is done.

111
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.790
Okay.

112
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.230
And it's always good

113
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.550
to verify along with.

114
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.230
So what I can do is I can just have

115
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.680
my Thunder client here and let's try

116
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.240
to make a get request on slash.

117
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.880
Is my server working as expected?

118
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.360
Yes.

119
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.440
So if even if I do multiple times.

120
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.680
Yeah, my, my server is

121
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.840
working as expected, right?

122
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.200
Hello from the server.

123
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.880
So guys, we have successfully

124
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880
done our task one, right?

125
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.000
So this was your task

126
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.440
one which is now done.

127
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.680
So what I will do is I'll

128
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.400
just, I'll just strike it off.

129
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.160
So you can just strike

130
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.320
it off like this, okay.

131
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.040
Or even.

132
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.720
That's fine.

133
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.720
Let, let it be here.

134
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.250
Now what is my second task?

135
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.250
Second task is that you have to

136
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.610
make a get thing on slash contact us

137
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.770
that sends your email

138
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.770
and contact number to the user.

139
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.290
Now guys, tell me one thing.

140
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.650
Actually if you see if I even make

141
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.089
a post request on this, I am

142
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.490
still getting hello from server.

143
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.930
Do you think that is a good thing?

144
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.450
Because the document has mentioned

145
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.210
that if it is a get request only

146
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.690
then you have to send the request.

147
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.530
But even on post it is working.

148
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.520
So that means our server has a bug.

149
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.120
So this is a bug, right?

150
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.600
So that means what I have to do is

151
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800
I have to first make a switch case

152
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.040
on the method, okay?

153
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.120
That if it is the get request then

154
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.000
I have to handle it differently.

155
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.880
And if it is a let's say post

156
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.120
request and I have to handle

157
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.640
them differently and so on.

158
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.279
Right?

159
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.080
So right now I just have to get, get

160
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.790
I can just you know handle the gate

161
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.230
and this switch should be here.

162
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.070
So that means now what you're

163
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.110
doing is if it's a get

164
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.390
request and the path is this only

165
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.390
then this should work.

166
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.510
Now see on the post you

167
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.430
are not getting anything.

168
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.430
You are not getting anything

169
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.110
because the server is

170
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.070
not able to do anything.

171
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.910
So that means if.

172
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.910
Okay, so let me just

173
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.470
do a return here.

174
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.510
So that means if you somehow reach

175
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.910
to this line in this

176
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.430
particular scenario, you are lost.

177
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.360
So response dot

178
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.760
write head saying 404.

179
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.240
Okay?

180
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.160
And you can just say dot n

181
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.280
saying, you are lost man.

182
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.800
Okay, you are lost.

183
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.440
Now see.

184
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.640
So now if I send the request,

185
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640
you are lost because

186
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.040
post request is not there.

187
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.600
But if I make a get request, I

188
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840
should get now it is good, right?

189
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.640
So you have a switch case first

190
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.760
of all on the method, then

191
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.480
you are making this path.

192
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.370
Second is contact us.

193
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.930
Right?

194
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.130
So pretty simple, right?

195
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.970
You inside the get only we need

196
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.370
a case for slash contact us.

197
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.730
And in this particular

198
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.690
scenario we will just send our

199
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.690
email and phone number.

200
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.290
So let's say that,

201
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.730
sure, you can contact me.

202
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.570
So my email is you know, Piyush

203
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.810
garg.dev@gmail.com and phone.

204
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.650
Okay, phone.

205
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.385
You can just send like +

206
00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:47.630
919-999-9999 something like this.

207
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.510
So that means if I make

208
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.950
a now get request onto slash

209
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.230
contact us and send.

210
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.390
So yeah, I'm getting the data fine.

211
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.950
But if I do a post request

212
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.990
on this, yeah, it should

213
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.070
say, you are lost, man.

214
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.550
Nice.

215
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.190
Nice.

216
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.230
Right, Makes sense.

217
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.150
Then if you make a post request

218
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.030
to slash tweet, it's kind of, you

219
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.350
know, that I want to do something.

220
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.220
It's basically like, you know,

221
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.500
user is trying to create a tweet.

222
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.420
We don't have a DB right

223
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.580
now, but okay, let's try

224
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.500
to mimic this thing.

225
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.980
Okay, so that means now

226
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.420
I need a new case.

227
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.140
So let's have a break to this one.

228
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.500
So I have a new case of post.

229
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.620
So all the post request

230
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.740
should be handled here.

231
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.220
So now again you have to switch

232
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.420
on the path and the path that we

233
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.420
are talking about is slash tweet.

234
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.420
So if there's a post request on tweet

235
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.780
in this particular scenario,

236
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.340
you can do a fake DB operation.

237
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.780
So let you can just assume that

238
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.060
we have a lot of code to do

239
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.810
that DB operation and stuff.

240
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.050
But right now what I want

241
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.730
to do is, I want.

242
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.370
I'll just say 2,01 because

243
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.770
when you do a post on something

244
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.850
and that thing is created something

245
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.490
like the user post a request

246
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.330
on slash tweet, which

247
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.250
internally created some resource.

248
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.450
So 201 is the correct status quo.

249
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.050
And you can say like your

250
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.490
tweet, your tweet was created

251
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.770
something like this.

252
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.290
Okay, so we are just mimicking it.

253
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.240
So that means if I now make

254
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.000
a request, okay, so if I now make

255
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.360
a request to slash tweet,

256
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.440
get Request will give me a 404.

257
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.560
But this time post

258
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.520
request is going to work.

259
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.040
That is to go one created.

260
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.520
Nice.

261
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.280
See, get request is not working.

262
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.760
Now even it is saying that, hey,

263
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240
you have to make a get request also

264
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.640
for slash tweet, which basically

265
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.560
sends all the tweet from the db.

266
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.040
Okay, so back to the script.

267
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.120
Okay, so back to the script file.

268
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.560
So inside this get

269
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.470
we have the switch.

270
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.270
So here what I can do is I can just

271
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.230
copy this particular thing,

272
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.750
paste it again here, and this time

273
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.150
we can name it to slash tweet.

274
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.470
So that means now what I am doing is.

275
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.030
Okay, so now what we are doing is we

276
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.470
are creating a slash tweet also.

277
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.750
See, now we have two parts.

278
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.470
Slash tweet.

279
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.270
Slash tweet.

280
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.630
The only difference is this is for

281
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.590
the post and this is for the get.

282
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.030
So here we can just say 200,

283
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.430
and I can just send hey, tweet one

284
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.430
tweet to something like this.

285
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.470
So tweet one and new line.

286
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.990
So in future we will actually

287
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.990
get it from the database.

288
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.950
But right now we don't have a db,

289
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.790
so I can just send

290
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.110
all the tweets like this.

291
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.070
So making a get request

292
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.510
on slash tweet, you are getting

293
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.750
the tweet one, tweet two.

294
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.310
But if you are make a post request

295
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.110
on this right, then

296
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.750
you are creating a new one.

297
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.310
Nice.

298
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.910
Right, so you can see our

299
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.950
server is going very good.

300
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.150
Right now there is a final

301
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.430
challenge remaining that you need

302
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.350
to log all the incoming requests

303
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.630
with the timestamp and log it

304
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.930
into the log.txt file.

305
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560
So that means you have

306
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.640
to create a lock.

307
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.000
So let's say that my log looks

308
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.760
something like this, that

309
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.320
there was an incoming request.

310
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.600
So let's have the date first.

311
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.679
Okay, so I can just say,

312
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.840
I'll just have the date dot.

313
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.520
You can have.

314
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.280
Now you can just say dot to string.

315
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.320
Let's just say date.

316
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.920
Now then what you have

317
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.720
to do is like you will just say,

318
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.160
hey, on which kind

319
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.680
of method the request was coming?

320
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.240
Let's say.

321
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.400
So it was coming on this

322
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.200
particular method.

323
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.170
And what was the path.

324
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.570
Great.

325
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.970
What was the path that user

326
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.730
was trying to access?

327
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.410
So let's say this is how

328
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.530
you constructed a log.

329
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.010
So every time there is a request,

330
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.570
you have to create this log Txt

331
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.010
file, you have to append it.

332
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.570
So to work with files, do

333
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.570
you remember that FS

334
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.850
module that we covered?

335
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.330
So you can just import that node fs

336
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.530
module and I can just say fs.append

337
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.170
to a file in a Synchronous way.

338
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.770
That's fine because every request

339
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.330
that will come user has

340
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.860
to first make an entry, right?

341
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.900
So we are just appending

342
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.540
to a file that is log Txt,

343
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.100
what is the data that is this log.

344
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.180
And I want to write it as a UTF8.

345
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.620
Okay?

346
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.380
That is UTF8 format.

347
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.260
Now what will happen is anytime

348
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.700
you get a request, let's make

349
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.500
a post request to slash tweet.

350
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.660
Okay, A log is created.

351
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.180
A log is created.

352
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.580
Now.

353
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.860
Why this dollar is coming here?

354
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.820
Just one second.

355
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.020
This dollar should not be here.

356
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.340
And also please guys, don't

357
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.420
forget to add a new line.

358
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.540
Okay, so first Got it.

359
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.700
Then let's make a get

360
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.020
request to slash tweet.

361
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.860
Okay, working.

362
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.020
Let's make a get request

363
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.300
to this thing and let's try

364
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.340
to make a request to contact us.

365
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.660
Which is also good.

366
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.580
And let's try to make a post

367
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.460
request on this thing.

368
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.580
Oh, you are lost.

369
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.500
Now if I check my log txt, you

370
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.180
are having all the logs that

371
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.860
at what time what kind

372
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.560
of requests one were coming, right?

373
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.360
So this is like your server logs.

374
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.600
So if you're monitoring your

375
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.600
server you can actually see that

376
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.520
when the requests were coming.

377
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.120
And if someone is trying to hack

378
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.200
into something, someone is

379
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.440
trying something different.

380
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.360
So yeah, you have all

381
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840
the information, right.

382
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.280
So this is pretty cool.

383
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.560
So this is how you can actually

384
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.280
create a logger and logs

385
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.600
all the incoming requests.

386
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.080
So when you go into the production

387
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.600
you have this distributed

388
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.840
logging system.

389
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.560
So all the incoming requests are,

390
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.040
are logged so that they

391
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.600
are kept for the future reference

392
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.760
if something goes bad.

393
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.240
Let's say your server is down

394
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.840
so you have some data that

395
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.280
why the server crashed.

396
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.680
Oh, there was a this kind

397
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.360
of request which could be there.

398
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.800
Right.

399
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.040
So this helps in debugging the stuff.

400
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.480
Okay, so this is how we have

401
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.600
created a very simple server

402
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.040
which now supports.

403
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.920
Okay, let me just show you

404
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.120
the full code which supports

405
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.680
two methods, get and post.

406
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.120
And you have couple of routes

407
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.840
and get and you have

408
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.960
a couple of routes in post.
