1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.600
All right.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.880
Another day, another

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.480
project that we have to do.

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.160
So this time the project is going

5
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.760
little bit complex and as you will

6
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.240
move forward the project are going

7
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.800
to be little bit more complex.

8
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.720
Nothing much, nothing

9
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.960
to be worried on.

10
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.040
So the next project that

11
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.360
we have is this one.

12
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.720
We have a T stall which

13
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.560
offers different prices

14
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.080
for different cup sizes.

15
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.280
Very valid.

16
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.800
Write a program that calculates

17
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.440
the price based on the size.

18
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.960
And I want your attention fully

19
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.880
on the problem statement.

20
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
So I'll remove myself from the screen

21
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.640
so that you get full attention

22
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.820
on the screen itself, nothing else.

23
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.300
So try to analyze this program.

24
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
No need to hurry up.

25
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.740
Try to pause and even see that

26
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.340
how you will approach this program,

27
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.020
at least, at least some

28
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.340
part of the task, you can

29
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.140
actually go ahead and do this.

30
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.220
So write a program that

31
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.460
calculates the price.

32
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.460
So the first step is input

33
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.060
small, medium or large.

34
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.900
That simply says that user is trying

35
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.580
to give me an input based on small,

36
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.580
medium or large as a price size.

37
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.420
And we have done this

38
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.180
in the past as well.

39
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
This is not anything new to us.

40
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.560
Then we have to evaluate

41
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.600
for the three conditions.

42
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.640
This time it can be a small, it can

43
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.319
be a medium, or it can be a large.

44
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.160
But the difference is this time

45
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.720
we have to take different decision

46
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.840
based on what's happening.

47
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240
Previously we were just checking for

48
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.680
the OR condition cookies or samosa.

49
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.960
This time we are actually

50
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.240
taking different steps or we

51
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.520
are taking different measures

52
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.600
based on different

53
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.200
condition that we are checking.

54
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.320
So we have to be little bit

55
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.680
more thorough this time.

56
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440
And if we don't see any

57
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.840
of the cup size between small,

58
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.120
medium and large, we simply

59
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.440
say is unknown cup size.

60
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.230
So let's take down this problem

61
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.590
and try to build this

62
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.430
small chai price calculator.

63
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.590
Let's go ahead and close this

64
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.270
and create the new one.

65
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.470
And this one is chai

66
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.230
price calculator.

67
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.910
PY of course.

68
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.310
So the step one should be very

69
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.630
clear and I think everybody

70
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.870
should be able to do this.

71
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.830
This is input.

72
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.110
We have done this in the past.

73
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.190
You simply go ahead and put

74
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.150
up a message

75
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.830
which says something like this.

76
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.030
Choose your cup size.

77
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.910
And we also will give some message

78
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.350
to the user, an indication that

79
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.750
you can only choose from small

80
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.630
or you can choose from medium,

81
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.909
or you can choose from large.

82
00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.870
And whatever the user says, we'll

83
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630
just go ahead and add a dot lower.

84
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.910
We have already seen this is a good

85
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.790
practice that we can apply and we

86
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.470
have to store this into a variable.

87
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.230
Let's call this one as simply cup

88
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.590
or user input cup, whatever you

89
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.110
want to call now don't worry.

90
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.800
Automatically this my

91
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.830
co data actually wrap the lines.

92
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.070
If they don't fit in the same

93
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.110
line, it automatically

94
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.310
moves into the next line.

95
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.230
But again, nothing to worry.

96
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.310
It's still on the same line.

97
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.670
No indentation is going on.

98
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.950
Okay, once this is done,

99
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.230
now we have to evaluate.

100
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.990
For evaluation we simply can say

101
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.070
if the cup is equals to

102
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.030
the variable small or the checking

103
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.660
that we are doing for is small

104
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.970
and we pretty much know what to do.

105
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.970
We have seen this part so far, so

106
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.450
this shouldn't be a problem anymore.

107
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.290
And we're going to go ahead and say

108
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.730
that Your price is 10, rupees.

109
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.210
All right, this is all good.

110
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.290
We have seen this.

111
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.890
So this is 10 rupees.

112
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.930
Or we can use the rupee

113
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.530
symbol as well.

114
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.010
But this is all okay.

115
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.850
Now we have to check

116
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.330
for another condition.

117
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.810
So so far we have seen that

118
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.930
in the very first problem

119
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.410
statement we have if and else.

120
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.970
But what about this case when we

121
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.980
have to check for three condition or

122
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.300
probably more, we have

123
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.460
another keyword that we are going

124
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.060
to study instead of the else.

125
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.180
Just rewrite that.

126
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.180
We have another one which

127
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.940
is elif, also known as lf.

128
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.060
No other way.

129
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.900
We simply can check for cup now

130
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.940
and again put another condition that

131
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.700
I want to check the cup for medium.

132
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Now if the cup is of size medium,

133
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.100
I can go ahead and do another print

134
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.100
statement, something like this.

135
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.610
And I can say price is medium.

136
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.130
How much is the price for medium?

137
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.490
15 and 20 rupees.

138
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.930
15 rupees.

139
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.810
Rupees.

140
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.490
There we go.

141
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.170
We also have to check another one.

142
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.890
So no worries.

143
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.570
We can again use the same

144
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.610
lf and we can put up a check

145
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.690
for the condition.

146
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.610
And there we go.

147
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.410
We simply go ahead

148
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.250
and check for large.

149
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.330
We all have to check for

150
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.530
the lowercase large because

151
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.930
we are converting our input

152
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.210
into the all lowercase.

153
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.330
And in this part we'll just go ahead

154
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.850
and say print and we will say price.

155
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.410
Oops.

156
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.769
In the quotes I have to say

157
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.410
price is 20 rupees.

158
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.090
20 rupees.

159
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.530
For rest of the all things.

160
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.890
This is our conditional part.

161
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.130
So this is our part two where we

162
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.610
check for all the condition.

163
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.140
If invalid show cup unknown cup size.

164
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.580
So for rest of all the things, I

165
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.820
don't want to check anything when

166
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.980
you don't want to check anything

167
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.740
else is again your best friend.

168
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.220
So we simply go ahead and say

169
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.860
print and we are going

170
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.180
to say unknown cup size.

171
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.700
So I hope now you understand that

172
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.300
why I didn't want it to teach you

173
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.940
about just the conditionals and

174
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.900
just the keywords, because these

175
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.980
kinds of real world

176
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.860
implementation, you only and only

177
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.180
learn when you actually solve

178
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.780
these kinds of problems.

179
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.780
Again, we have studied that.

180
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.300
What's the importance of converting

181
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.820
everything, what we are taking from

182
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.860
the user into a single case, whether

183
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.700
that's an upper case or lowercase.

184
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.060
And what's really important

185
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.180
that we go through

186
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.780
with these cycles of this.

187
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.050
This is really boring of a,

188
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.540
learning process if you just go

189
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.220
ahead and learn the syntax.

190
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.500
But this time we are actually taking

191
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.580
