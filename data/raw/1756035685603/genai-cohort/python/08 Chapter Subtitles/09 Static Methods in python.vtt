00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.000
Next up in this video we are going

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.640
to talk about static methods.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.240
They are actually very fun

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.160
and pretty easy to work on with.

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.280
I'll just walk you through.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.360
So let's go ahead and get

7
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.200
into the new file.

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.640
And by the way, static methods are

9
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.320
helpful when you want utility

10
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.240
functions grouped with your classes

11
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.560
without depending on any instance.

12
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.440
And I know this is a lot and you

13
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720
might be thinking I didn't got it.

14
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.000
What do you really mean

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to say with this jargon?

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.480
Don't worry, I will explain you

17
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.360
with the code and it

18
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.560
will be super, super easy.

19
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.600
Let me go ahead and create

20
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.040
a new file for you.

21
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.640
And let's create this one.

22
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.320
And we're going to call 09

23
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.360
and this one will be static method.

24
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.320
It can be method or methods.

25
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.440
Don't judge me on that.

26
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080
But we're going to just go like that.

27
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
So let's go ahead and create a new

28
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.920
file and start writing some code.

29
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.360
Now in order to start with

30
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.040
static method, first of all,

31
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.600
let me get this up here.

32
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.880
Go ahead and create a simple class.

33
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.640
This will be a simple class

34
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200
which says chai utils a simple

35
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800
utility for the chai.

36
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.880
And again we can go

37
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880
really crazy in that.

38
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.720
But we'll just go

39
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.040
with the simple one.

40
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.480
So I can just go ahead and define

41
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.000
a method just like this.

42
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.040
Let's call this one as

43
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.240
clean ingredients.

44
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.760
Clean ingredients.

45
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920
And it will receive a text with this.

46
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.600
This method just receives a text.

47
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.280
Pretty simple.

48
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.860
And what it does, it

49
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.780
loops through the value.

50
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.580
So it just says for item in text.

51
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.700
And it takes the whole text

52
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.100
and split it and use a method known

53
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.220
as split with all the text

54
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.100
and splits it based on the comma.

55
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.500
All right, so we receive a long text

56
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.140
which might have a comma and we

57
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.900
just split them based on the comma.

58
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.380
Once we are done with this, we

59
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.540
want to actually go ahead

60
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.700
and get the response and remove

61
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.300
all the spacing from it.

62
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.940
Got it.

63
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.060
Pretty simple.

64
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.820
So I'll just go ahead and put up.

65
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.500
This is the part we have studied.

66
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.060
So if you remember this, we can

67
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.580
create an array just like this.

68
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.780
And now I can actually comprehend it.

69
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.460
So I'll receive an item here.

70
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.540
That is we have studied and I also

71
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.620
further want to strip it down.

72
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140
So there we go.

73
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.860
And we're going to return this.

74
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.340
This is a really classic way

75
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.780
of writing, the things.

76
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.900
So let me give you an example

77
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.380
of how this will actually work.

78
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.330
So let's just say you have

79
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.410
a simple string just like this.

80
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.890
You have a space at the start.

81
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.330
Then you simply say water and then

82
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.690
probably you have one more space,

83
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.330
then you simply go like this and

84
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.490
then say you have milk, two spaces,

85
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.850
a comma and then we are going to

86
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.250
have ginger just like this and goes

87
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.850
like that.

88
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.690
So if any string like this is being

89
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.250
passed onto this, we are actually

90
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.370
going ahead and extracting all

91
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.450
the values separated by comma, then

92
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.050
stripping all the extra spaces.

93
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.990
That's why this item strip and.

94
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.070
And we get all the value

95
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.670
as a nice sorted array.

96
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.670
This is what it does.

97
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.590
Now there are a couple

98
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.630
of ways how you can use it.

99
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.750
Let's go ahead and define this.

100
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.990
So let's just say this is

101
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.670
a raw and this is a simple

102
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.910
string with a space.

103
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.950
We have a water, then a space, then

104
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.670
a comma and then we have milk, then

105
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.430
we have a space comma just like

106
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.990
this we have ginger, ginger which

107
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.030
also have a space and then finally

108
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.470
honey.

109
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.230
And that is how it looks like.

110
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.180
So we want that this string should be

111
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.900
passed on to this utility function

112
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.540
and we should extract the value.

113
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.780
Now most of the time what you're

114
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.700
going to do is we're going

115
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.020
to go ahead and create an object.

116
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.380
So let's call this one as object.

117
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.580
This object will be from

118
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.980
the chai utils just like this.

119
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.780
And now through this object I can

120
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.220
just go ahead and call the method

121
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.980
cleaningredients and then I have

122
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.620
to pass this raw method.

123
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.180
Absolutely nothing wrong with this.

124
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.420
This is the usual aspect or usual way

125
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.580
of how we build the things.

126
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.000
But, but there is another way

127
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.600
that these are the things which

128
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.760
doesn't need any object.

129
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.840
We just want that something

130
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.040
needs to be passed on through

131
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.320
this kind of a method.

132
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.640
So there is another interesting

133
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.920
way and this is where

134
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.200
the decorator comes up.

135
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.280
So you can just go

136
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280
just about this one.

137
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.600
And by the way ignore this part

138
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.400
up here and I can just annotate this

139
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.920
with a static method use at the rate

140
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.800
and then say static method.

141
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.400
Now your way of writing the code

142
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.760
is now going to be different.

143
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.850
You can directly use this

144
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.730
chai utils and have

145
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.810
the method.cleaningredients.

146
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.850
yes, we can now do this and pass

147
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.650
on a raw value just here and we

148
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.050
can store this raw value here.

149
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.690
So let's just call

150
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.050
this one as cleaned.

151
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.050
And now we can just go ahead

152
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.010
and print this cleaned.

153
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.050
There we go.

154
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.570
So I hope you got the value

155
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.370
that how the static method

156
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.490
and they are used quite a lot.

157
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.970
They are used quite a lot.

158
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.730
Let me show you by opening this

159
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.930
up and we will say Python 3 and this

160
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.810
will be 09 and there we go.

161
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.830
We got all the values.

162
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.470
Can we do this with

163
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.550
the previous method as well?

164
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.110
Of course.

165
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.910
But static method are those

166
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.150
methods which doesn't

167
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.710
require any object creation.

168
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.830
They are not dependent on the object.

169
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.110
You can directly go ahead

170
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.910
and use the classes and as

171
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.990
a utility methods and these are

172
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.710
very common in utilities.

173
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.990
You create a lot of utilities

174
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.670
like database interactions

175
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.670
and especially in the fastapi,

176
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.790
a lot of them are there.

177
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.430
So directly use the class name.

178
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.830
And this is also another

179
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.950
one way of using it.

180
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.620
So this is it.

181
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.580
For the static methods,

182
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.220
there is nothing more

183
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.260
to it, nothing less to it.

184
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.700
It's just a way and how you do it.

185
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.460
And make sure you don't

186
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.500
forget the decorator.

187
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.620
If you intend it that this method

188
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.140
should be allowed to be used

189
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.180
without creating an object.
