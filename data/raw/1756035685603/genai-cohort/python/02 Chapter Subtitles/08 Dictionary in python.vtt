00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.760
All right, so first of all,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.880
let's close this and then

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720
make sure that you have reviewed us.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720
Your review is truly important

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.920
for Udemy.

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.120
And without the reviews,

7
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.360
the Udemy course don't grow much.

8
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.440
That's why I'm reminding you

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.959
again and again, I don't like

10
00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.360
it, but I have to do it.

11
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.480
All right, so the next topic that we

12
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.800
are going to work is dictionary.

13
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.480
So why does dictionary exist?

14
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.640
Once you understand the meaning

15
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.920
of it, then you'll be probably okay.

16
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.280
That okay, why this exist?

17
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.420
So so far whatever we have seen,

18
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420
like for example, we

19
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.060
have seen the list exist.

20
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.340
The whole point of list

21
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.740
being existing here.

22
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.860
So for example, let's just

23
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.740
say we choose Ginger and we choose

24
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.820
Lemon and all of this.

25
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.660
There is no way of pointing

26
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.380
out that hey, where is Lemon?

27
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.380
Or is this.

28
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.580
What type of this?

29
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.140
So in order to address any one

30
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.580
of them, we have indexing system.

31
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.340
So we have zero and then we

32
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.580
have one just like this.

33
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.460
So we have a zero.

34
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.660
Come on, don't do it like this.

35
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.860
So we have indexing based on this.

36
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.460
So we have this zero here.

37
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.540
And if we have one here just

38
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.420
like this in no matter what

39
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.980
happens, I have to always

40
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.820
call this from the number zero.

41
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.700
This one always from the number one.

42
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.500
But it would be really nice that

43
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.220
if you have something which is

44
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.660
named based indexing, I can

45
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.700
call it as something like name.

46
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.140
Or for example you are using

47
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.700
or you are storing another

48
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.500
things in the database.

49
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.860
For example, I want to call

50
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.820
this as Hitesh and I want

51
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.340
to call this one as my last name.

52
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.340
So there should be a way

53
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.340
that I should call it as.

54
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.780
Instead of 0 and 1 I should

55
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.740
be able to call this

56
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.220
I don't like this one here.

57
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.220
I would love to call this as

58
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.500
first name and I can point

59
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.180
the first name to this.

60
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.500
It would be super awesome.

61
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.020
And that's exactly what

62
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.350
dictionary does it.

63
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.950
It gives you named argument.

64
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.030
You can actually store the data

65
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.710
just like this.

66
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.710
But each data will be pointed

67
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.670
through the name instead

68
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.830
of the zeros and one.

69
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.510
That is all.

70
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.950
That is all your dictionary is about.

71
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.190
And why do you go like this?

72
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.710
There we go, dictionary.

73
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.270
So let's go ahead and code it out.

74
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.229
It's a super simple piece of code.

75
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.350
We will call this one as chapter 10.

76
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.670
Py quite far, isn't it?

77
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.630
In the journey.

78
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.310
And I think we should rename this

79
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.590
bothers me a little bit.

80
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.270
Oops, don't want to delete it.

81
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.870
Let's rename this and I want

82
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.070
to call this one as chapter 10.

83
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.510
Okay, so how do we have

84
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.310
a dictionary in us.

85
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.710
So first of all let me close this

86
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.510
and let's just say you

87
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.870
have chiorder and you want

88
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.110
to store them in the dictionary.

89
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.390
You call dictionary just like

90
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.670
this, then a parenthesis

91
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.200
because it's a function.

92
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.440
And then you simply define that.

93
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.200
Hey, the type is going to be

94
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.040
this one is masala chai.

95
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.800
And then we want another one.

96
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.160
We have size

97
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.880
and the size could be large.

98
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.360
What else information

99
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.080
you want to store?

100
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.320
Maybe sugar information, how

101
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.360
much sugar you want to have.

102
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360
So there we go.

103
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.480
Now this actually makes

104
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.680
my list much easier.

105
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.520
This is still list,

106
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.680
but it is a dictionary.

107
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.960
So it's a dictionary list

108
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.420
and I can store my information,

109
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.980
which gives me much more idea.

110
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.180
And I'm pretty sure you are

111
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.340
wondering how does it look

112
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.940
like when we print this up?

113
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.860
Always remember in the dictionary

114
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.220
order doesn't really matter.

115
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.220
Masala chai could be first or sugar

116
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.380
could also be first because we

117
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.780
reference the element by their name.

118
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.700
So we're going to call this

119
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.820
one as chai order just like this

120
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.420
and we'll say chai order.

121
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.740
Let's go ahead and print this out.

122
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.820
So we'll just go ahead

123
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.510
and say this one is one.

124
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.340
There we go.

125
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.260
So we can see we have the chai order.

126
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.940
Then we have type, masala, chai,

127
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.460
size, sugar and all of them.

128
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.900
This is much better of information.

129
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.740
Now let me walk you through more

130
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.020
of how we add the data.

131
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.740
Accessing data.

132
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.660
This is just a brief overview of it.

133
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.900
Let me go in depth of this now.

134
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.820
So for example, we

135
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.100
have a chai recipe.

136
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.380
Recipe.

137
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.460
There we go.

138
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.140
We have chai recipe and in this

139
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.500
we have an empty dictionary.

140
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.500
This is another way

141
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.460
of creating the dictionary.

142
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.940
If you have data, use dict or you

143
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.320
can use this curly braces as well.

144
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.200
But this is the most common way.

145
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.160
Now in each of this chai recipe

146
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.480
I want to add more data.

147
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.959
The way how we add the data is

148
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.200
by square brackets.

149
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.640
Then name your key.

150
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.720
This will be my key.

151
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.600
So this key name is, let's just say

152
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.679
base and then value, that I want

153
00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.760
to add here is going to be black T.

154
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.240
This is exactly same the way

155
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.680
we call it as type or

156
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.320
maybe size or maybe sugar.

157
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.280
This is exactly what

158
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.960
we are doing here.

159
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.650
Base the value.

160
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.010
Like it could be masala chai, it

161
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.330
could be large, it could be two.

162
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.850
The same as here the black T.

163
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.010
That is it.

164
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.050
Now let's just say we want

165
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.170
to add one more thing,

166
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.970
but this time instead of base.

167
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.890
Otherwise we will overwrite it.

168
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.570
Let's call this one as liquid.

169
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.010
And I want to have

170
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.730
a liquid base of milk.

171
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.090
I don't prefer it, but let's

172
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.050
just say we have it now.

173
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.890
How do we access the data for this?

174
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.900
We'll print this just like this

175
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.220
and we will say recipe

176
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.660
base and I want to access just

177
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.220
the base, not the liquid.

178
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.540
So all I have to do is say chai

179
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.540
recipe and again use the same

180
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.380
mechanism how you added the data.

181
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.860
So there we go.

182
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.020
We add the base again.

183
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.780
Don't worry too much

184
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.700
about the single quotes.

185
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.260
Double quote.

186
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.580
That is totally fine both way.

187
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.140
It is absolutely fine.

188
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.260
If I go ahead and open this up, clean

189
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.020
this and run this notice here we

190
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.020
get the black T, not the whole milk

191
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.380
and everything, just the black T.

192
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.540
This is how you access this.

193
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.190
You can definitely go ahead

194
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.910
and remove some of the data as well.

195
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.350
We use del del to delete any

196
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.190
component inside the dictionary.

197
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.070
So how do we do that?

198
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.830
We simply say, hey, chai recipe

199
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.270
inside you there is known as a,

200
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.110
liquid and I want to just remove it.

201
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.150
You just have to provide

202
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.470
the key to remove it.

203
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.510
That is it.

204
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.910
Now let's just say if we go ahead

205
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.190
and print out the chai recipe, not

206
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.590
the base, I want to print out the

207
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.870
whole and we'll just call this as

208
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.790
recipe and we'll have another one.

209
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.190
So one printout we are doing before

210
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.670
deleting and after deleting

211
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.950
the liquid, we are doing one more

212
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.630
printout to just verify the claim

213
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.670
that we have made just right now.

214
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.029
So we'll clean this up.

215
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.590
There we go.

216
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.230
We have a base black T.

217
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.150
Then we have a liquid

218
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.190
key with the milk.

219
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.750
And now we can see we have just

220
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.430
the base black T because we have

221
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.520
removed, we have removed the liquid.

222
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.960
That is it.

223
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.640
Super simple.

224
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.240
Remember, there's nothing too

225
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.360
much going on in this one.

226
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.960
No surprises, no magic.

227
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.640
And yes, we can also do membership

228
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.280
testing in this one as well.

229
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.120
Whenever there's a data, there's

230
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.800
a list almost everywhere.

231
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.560
When there's a list, however, it

232
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.960
is contained in the square brackets

233
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.520
and curly braces and set.

234
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.000
You can perform membership test.

235
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.200
Let's go ahead and do this.

236
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
So we are going to say like this and

237
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.000
we will say is sugar, in the order

238
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.280
you want to test now whether sugar

239
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.320
exists in your very first element,

240
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.360
the chai order, is it available or

241
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.640
not?

242
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.160
So we can do a pretty easy stuff.

243
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.360
We can just go ahead and use

244
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.439
the curly braces

245
00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.000
and I will just ask for sugar

246
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.720
in wherever you want to ask.

247
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
I want to ask for chai order.

248
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.800
Again, super simple.

249
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800
We have seen the membership

250
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.240
testing many, many times.

251
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.080
So true, because sugar is

252
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.840
there and no worries at all.

253
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.270
Now there are a lot of things

254
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.550
that you can do with this.

255
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.790
I will actually go ahead

256
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.430
and walk you through with this.

257
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.470
So let's just say we

258
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.910
redefine the chai order.

259
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.230
So I'll just go ahead and have

260
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.550
a new order in this one.

261
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.350
So there we go.

262
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.630
This time the new order

263
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.950
is type ginger chai.

264
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.100
We have a size of medium sugar,

265
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.190
just like we have at the top.

266
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.670
So I've just redefined the new.

267
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.950
It's a new order.

268
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.030
Now we can actually check

269
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.230
what are all the keys, what

270
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.430
are all the values, what

271
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.630
are the full order items.

272
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.070
All of this.

273
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.030
This is something that you will

274
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.570
be doing quite a lot and this

275
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.290
is super easy to work on with.

276
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.210
So I will just go ahead

277
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.770
and say I want to print

278
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.770
and I will say order details.

279
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.130
This time I want

280
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.690
to print the keys only.

281
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.090
So if you want to print just

282
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.810
the keys, it is super simple.

283
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.010
I can just have the chai

284
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.410
order and I have dot.

285
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.450
This gives me all

286
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.570
the things that I can do.

287
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.370
And yes, we have

288
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.250
already seen the pop.

289
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.810
The way how POP works in the list

290
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.450
that exactly how it works

291
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.040
in the dictionary as well.

292
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.120
Items, keys, get from keys.

293
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.840
There's a lot of things.

294
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.640
Update the things.

295
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.600
If you want to update

296
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.120
certain things, values.

297
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.360
All of this when you

298
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.320
simply run the keys.

299
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.560
And again this is a method so

300
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.400
you have to just go ahead

301
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.720
and put parenthesis after it.

302
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.080
You will get all the keys.

303
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.600
What do I mean by keys?

304
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.960
The type is a key,

305
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.799
size is a key, sugar is a key.

306
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.240
And similarly I can get

307
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.679
all the values as well.

308
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.400
So I can just go

309
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.679
ahead and say values.

310
00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:46.609
And again this time we'll say values.

311
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.729
So we have separated them, each one

312
00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.449
of them that hey, this will be my

313
00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:53.009
printout for all the keys.

314
00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:54.209
And this will be my printout

315
00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:55.049
for all the values.

316
00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:57.209
If you want to get all the items.

317
00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.008
Yes, there is a way or a detail.

318
00:09:00.008 --> 00:09:01.449
I'll just say items

319
00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:03.369
and you guessed it right, there

320
00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:04.969
is items here as well.

321
00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:06.409
Let's go ahead and print it out so

322
00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:07.769
that we can see what's happening.

323
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:09.700
There we go.

324
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.860
A little bit hard to see, but again,

325
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.300
just pay a little attention.

326
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.740
This is Order details Keys 1,

327
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.060
these are DICT keys.

328
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.020
So dictionary keys.

329
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.220
Again, there is a way how you

330
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.260
extract each one of them.

331
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.620
We have to go through with one

332
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.700
of them known as loop.

333
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.140
But again you get the point.

334
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.380
We are just getting back.

335
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.740
A list means an array

336
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.620
and it has type, size and sugar.

337
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.620
Then in the values notice here,

338
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.180
order detail values, we are

339
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.260
getting values which has

340
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.000
ginger, chai, medium and one.

341
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.960
Pretty nice.

342
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
Now when we are getting the order

343
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.760
details in the items

344
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.440
format, then we get all of this.

345
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.080
So we have an array.

346
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.280
Notice the data type.

347
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.640
That is the most important part.

348
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.240
A lot of people study the data type.

349
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.440
Don't focus on the data type.

350
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.360
Don't do that.

351
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.160
So we have a whole

352
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.080
list outside of this.

353
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.360
But inside the list we have a tuple.

354
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.880
We just studied about it.

355
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.960
In the tuple we see a key pair.

356
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.380
The type is ginger chai, the size

357
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.700
is medium and the sugar is one.

358
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.660
So we have a tuple

359
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.860
of each one of them.

360
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.900
And this is really useful.

361
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.460
It's really beautiful.

362
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.980
So let's go ahead and do

363
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.340
a couple of more stuff.

364
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.020
I will just comment this out so you

365
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.700
can select all of them and press

366
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.100
slash so that it gets commented out.

367
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.980
Otherwise it will be

368
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.700
keep on printing.

369
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700
I don't want it to be.

370
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.260
I don't want to execute this

371
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.380
whole piece.

372
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.180
So I can just use last item

373
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.900
and I can use the chai order

374
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.220
and I can pop an item.

375
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.980
I will just go ahead

376
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.020
and say pop item.

377
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.860
Not just pop, I want

378
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.420
to pop the whole item.

379
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.180
This will obviously remove this

380
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.580
thing, the entirety of the thing.

381
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.380
And you can actually

382
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.860
print this as well.

383
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.940
I will print just like this and I

384
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.220
will say removed last item.

385
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.300
And the value is last item.

386
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.350
There we go.

387
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.460
Similarly, we can actually

388
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.380
pop the sugar level as well.

389
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.480
If you want to pop, some like.

390
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.280
I will give you the example.

391
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.080
I think first let's print this out.

392
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.960
That will be better.

393
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.440
So removed item, sugar is one.

394
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.680
So now in our order

395
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.720
there is no sugar item.

396
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.800
So let's go ahead and use this.

397
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.680
We can actually use it

398
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.160
in quite a lot of ways.

399
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.400
But I think you got the idea.

400
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.520
I should not be confusing you

401
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.960
with more example pop item

402
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960
just removes the item.

403
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.760
That is it.

404
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.920
Now you can also go ahead

405
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.320
and update certain things as well.

406
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.920
Just like this.

407
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.580
So let's just say I have

408
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.740
a simple and a small example.

409
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.380
I'll just go ahead and bring it

410
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.100
up because don't want to write it.

411
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.700
So let's just say we have spices.

412
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.220
We have previously written this.

413
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.260
No big deal.

414
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.860
We have cardamom.

415
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.220
We have crushed

416
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.540
ginger will be sliced.

417
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.820
So again, key value pair

418
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.340
could be anything.

419
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.300
Key can be anything.

420
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.220
Value could be anything.

421
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.380
Almost anything.

422
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.100
This time my key is just like this,

423
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.580
this one is value again.

424
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.740
So a lot of things can happen.

425
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.340
Now you want to update certain thing.

426
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.440
Maybe, you want to update

427
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.360
extra spices or you want

428
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.680
to update a chai recipe.

429
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.160
Remember we have a chai recipe

430
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.800
which has a base liquid.

431
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.920
Now you have more detail.

432
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.680
So what happens when I go ahead

433
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.640
and say, hey, chai recipe,

434
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.960
I want to go ahead and update you.

435
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.880
And while updating, I'm providing

436
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.720
you these extra spices.

437
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.480
Yeah, that's an interesting

438
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.160
observation to have.

439
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.760
And again, we can just print it out.

440
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.960
So let's just say we simply

441
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.200
go ahead and remove this.

442
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.200
And we will say updated chai recipe.

443
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.400
Updated chai recipe.

444
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.200
Recipe.

445
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.920
There we go.

446
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.880
And we will say chai recipe now.

447
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.200
There we go.

448
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.920
So this is what we have, chai recipe.

449
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.040
And again, we will investigate

450
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.880
this first, try

451
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.050
to predict what might happen.

452
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.170
That's always a good idea.

453
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.810
Let's go ahead and run this.

454
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.450
And there we go.

455
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.530
Updated chai recipe.

456
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.370
We have a black T, we have cardamom

457
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.290
crushed and we have ginger.

458
00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:58.850
Pretty good.

459
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.610
And if you're wondering, hey,

460
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.130
in the chai recipe,

461
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.050
don't we have the liquid as well?

462
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.970
Don't forget we have

463
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.850
updated the code.

464
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.090
The liquid was removed.

465
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.770
So again, no worries on that.

466
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.970
And we have other things as well.

467
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.730
Like safely getting

468
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.970
the values out of this.

469
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.000
Let's just say we have, we want

470
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.480
to get some of more things.

471
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.880
Let's just say there is a customer

472
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.320
note I want to get out of the order.

473
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.200
But hey, when we design

474
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.120
the order, we have type ginger

475
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.600
size, medium, sugar one.

476
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.480
But there's no such

477
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.480
thing as customer order.

478
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.520
So what will happen if I try to print

479
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.880
this out or I want to get this?

480
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.200
Let's just say I want to get size.

481
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.960
So I'll just go ahead and say size

482
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.560
is going to be equal to or I will

483
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.770
just say better would be chai size.

484
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.410
And you know this already that

485
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.090
from the chai order

486
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.090
I can extract any one of them.

487
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.850
So I'll just extract the size.

488
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:59.210
And if I try to print this chai

489
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.050
size, that is okay, I will

490
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.770
update the message as well.

491
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.730
Chai size is.

492
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.570
Now focus on this.

493
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.250
This is a good code.

494
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.010
No problem at all.

495
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.130
If I go ahead and print

496
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.650
this out, all good choice.

497
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.050
Size is medium.

498
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.050
But what about if I try to get

499
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.970
something which is not yet there?

500
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.170
Maybe I want to get customer note.

501
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.090
Does customer note exist?

502
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.970
Probably not.

503
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.530
Or maybe customer underscore note.

504
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.490
What happens when I try to grab this?

505
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.170
If I grab this, I crash

506
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.250
my entire application.

507
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.570
It's not working anymore.

508
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.470
So there is a safe way of

509
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.710
getting the values out of this.

510
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.150
So in this case I would use

511
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.590
that hey, in the chai order,

512
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.350
I would like to use a method

513
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.270
that is dot get what it does.

514
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.550
It safely gets whatever

515
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.790
you're trying to get.

516
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.470
For example, I want to grab

517
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.030
a customer note and I will just go

518
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.590
ahead and call this one as note.

519
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.750
We'll still call it as chai size

520
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.510
or I'll change this one as well.

521
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.080
But if I don't get the note,

522
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.600
I mark this as no note.

523
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.960
No note was given to by the customer.

524
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.240
I think instead of the chai

525
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.600
size now it's better

526
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.840
to call it as Customer Note.

527
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.680
And then I can just print

528
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.200
this one as Customer Note.

529
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.400
Customer note is.

530
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.840
And what you will notice that now

531
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.600
the app is not crashing but it's

532
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.120
saying hey, no note was available.

533
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.840
And just to give you an example,

534
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.320
instead of the no note you

535
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320
can actually provide that

536
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.680
hey, I want to grab the size.

537
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.880
The message doesn't make sense

538
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.400
but you will get the point.

539
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.800
What I'm trying to say that hey,

540
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.920
it's medium so it gets the thing

541
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.760
which you want but it doesn't crash.

542
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.719
Instead of if it doesn't find it.

543
00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.720
I can provide the default value

544
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.400
here, which is pretty cool.

545
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.000
I like this approach.

546
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.400
And there are a lot of things that

547
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.640
you can do with the dictionary.

548
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.720
Again you have to read a little bit

549
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.890
of the docs and you

550
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.570
can provide a lot more information

551
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.530
in the dictionary.

552
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.370
And one last note before

553
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.530
we wrap this up video.

554
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.130
All the thing that we

555
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.570
studied in the sets.

556
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.330
Yeah, these all things actually

557
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.650
apply to dictionary as well.

558
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.730
I don't think there is a need

559
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.530
of again kind of redoing the things.

560
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.210
But yes, all the union operation

561
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.290
that you studied and all

562
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.330
these things, yes, they do exist

563
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.570
in the dictionary as well.

564
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.490
I think that is more than

565
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.330
enough information.

566
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.610
No point of doing it again

567
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.650
and again and again.

568
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.370
I hope this lecture was

569
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.250
interesting for you.

570
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.370
You enjoyed the learning

571
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.010
part of the data types.

572
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.250
We will do more operations

573
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.130
on this data type.

574
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.450
Right now we are just studying them.

575
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.490
That okay, this is

576
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.090
another type that exists.

577
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.210
That is it for this video.

578
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.810
Let's catch up in the next one.
