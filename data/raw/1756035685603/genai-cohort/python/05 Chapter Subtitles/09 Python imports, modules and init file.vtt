00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.800
This one is one of my favorite

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.760
topic in Python because a lot of

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.600
people write Python code but

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.880
just do guesswork when they have

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640
to bring in the code from other

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.800
files in their, actual working

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.600
file.

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
This is a really fun and

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.840
interesting topic, but rest

10
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.560
assured that after watching this

11
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.960
particular video, it might be a

12
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.440
little bit longer one, but you

13
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.640
will never face any problem in

14
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.040
importing any file from anywhere

15
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.390
into the Python.

16
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.710
I have seen this struggle with

17
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.310
the students who actually write

18
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.190
code in Django or Fast API.

19
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.830
They just keep on wondering why this

20
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.550
is happening, how this is happening.

21
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.150
You will get answer of all of this.

22
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.950
The video could be slightly longer

23
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470
than the usual one, but I want

24
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.510
to cover this all in one go.

25
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.630
So let me take you onto

26
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.670
the screen and we're going

27
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.750
to just work with this.

28
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.910
So it's a really simple

29
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.510
and fun thing to do.

30
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.590
Hope you remember the name.

31
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.270
What was the name?

32
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.230
This is Dunder.

33
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.510
I hope you do that.

34
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.590
All right, so let's go ahead

35
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.430
and talk about the imports.

36
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.350
And especially, I'll call this one

37
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.400
as importing objects or importing

38
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520
functions would also not be bad.

39
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.040
But everything is an object

40
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.280
in the world of Python, so

41
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.320
calling functions also as an object

42
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.000
is also a true statement.

43
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.560
Very, very weird.

44
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.280
But this is also a true

45
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.320
statement here.

46
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.360
All right, so let's talk

47
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.640
about why we need an import here.

48
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.560
Imagine you have a perfect

49
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.960
masala chai recipe.

50
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.160
You have saved it in a notebook.

51
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.840
And, what's that notebook?

52
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.830
That notebook is, masala chai py.

53
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.550
All right, we'll first grab

54
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790
the theory and then definitely 100%

55
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.750
will code out the things as well.

56
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.310
So this is one of your

57
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.510
file masalachai py.

58
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.190
Now, rather than rewriting the same

59
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.750
instruction every time you brew

60
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.910
a chai in a new shop, let's just say

61
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.030
you have opened up a new branch.

62
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.950
So let's just call this

63
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.210
one as, new branch py.

64
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.170
Of course.

65
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.850
So we opened up this new branch.

66
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.650
So would you rather go ahead and get

67
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.330
this masala chai every single

68
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.810
time, write a fresh function?

69
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.130
No, we want to import this

70
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.570
into the masala chai.

71
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.450
So how do we do this?

72
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.090
How we bring the code from masala

73
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.850
chai py into the new branch?

74
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.490
There are a couple

75
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.370
of ways how we do it.

76
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.610
We'll surely write the Python

77
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.650
code first, grab the theory.

78
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.650
So we can just go ahead

79
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.040
and say import masala.

80
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.840
I wrote it, correct?

81
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.520
Yep.

82
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.600
Import masalachai py.

83
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.680
Once you write this statement

84
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.000
at the very top, what this statement

85
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.400
will allow you to do is you can just

86
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.120
go ahead and use something like this

87
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.480
Masalachai and then use a method.

88
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.880
Maybe this whole file.

89
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.000
Masalachai py has a lot of methods

90
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.640
but we want to use a brew method.

91
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200
I can call all of this method here.

92
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.810
So, so this will be my code if I

93
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.410
go ahead and bring it up here.

94
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.050
Now what we are doing is you

95
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.090
are bringing the full recipe

96
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.050
notebook to the table.

97
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.050
You are not bringing one

98
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.290
method or two things, you are

99
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050
bringing the whole recipe.

100
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.050
It's just like flipping

101
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.090
the pages and finding

102
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.490
the right methods for this.

103
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.369
There could be another

104
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:02.210
way of doing this.

105
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.290
So this is one way.

106
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.350
There is no wrong or no right.

107
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.210
This is one way of doing the things.

108
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.770
Another way is saying that I don't

109
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.210
want the whole book to come in.

110
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.560
I, I want certain methods to come up.

111
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.840
So I can just go ahead and say

112
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.640
from Masalachai Py I want

113
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.440
to import not everything but let's

114
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160
just say the brew method.

115
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.160
So this is what I want to bring

116
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.760
in, only the brew method.

117
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.720
Now this gives me a really

118
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.120
interesting way to use this.

119
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.560
Now my file has the functionality

120
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.360
of brewing.

121
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.280
I can directly go ahead

122
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.480
and use the brew.

123
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.800
The only difference between this

124
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.720
and this here you have

125
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.480
to simply say okay from this book

126
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.050
use this particular method.

127
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.210
Some people prefer this,

128
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.290
some people prefer this.

129
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.690
And of course there are use

130
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.170
case scenarios of this.

131
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.130
So this is also a right way and this

132
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.810
is also an equally right way.

133
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.730
But you should know what

134
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.770
we are bringing in.

135
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.130
There is also another way.

136
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.970
Yeah, there is also interesting way.

137
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.890
Let's just say you don't want

138
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.890
to call it as brew.

139
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.970
Maybe your file still has a method

140
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.730
which is doing some brewing.

141
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.610
You want to change the name of it.

142
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.210
So I can go ahead and simply say

143
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.910
from Masala chai, import brew

144
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.310
but call it as start brewing.

145
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.110
Yeah, this simple as

146
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.470
brewing the moment you get

147
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.110
it as start brewing.

148
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.550
As start brewing.

149
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.630
Now I can simply go ahead and call

150
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.830
this one as start brewing.

151
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.790
So again we have literally

152
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.830
three ways of how we can import

153
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.430
the same thing from here.

154
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.070
So in the new branch

155
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.030
you have three ways.

156
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.710
Now we can actually import the whole

157
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.470
thing and call dot ways

158
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.500
and can get the methods out of it.

159
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.100
We can actually have the named

160
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.660
import that I only want brew

161
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.860
but if there are more methods

162
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.100
you can just comma separate them

163
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.620
and have more values of it.

164
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.300
For example the brew is

165
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.100
there or there is a prepare.

166
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.980
You get the idea.

167
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.740
So you can have as many as you wish.

168
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.260
Now these are the three ways.

169
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.300
I hope you got an idea.

170
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.300
Of how this can be done.

171
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.620
This was a very fictitious scenario.

172
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.060
But I also want to talk

173
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.100
on one more thing.

174
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.500
Sometimes you are importing things

175
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.100
which are not from the other files

176
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.450
but rather Python is giving you.

177
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.570
So there are other ways.

178
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.730
For example, you'll sometimes say

179
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.930
from datetime, which is a inbuilt

180
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.570
methods and inbuilt functionality

181
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.010
in the Python and you want

182
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.130
to say import, date, time.

183
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.810
So you are bringing from the datetime

184
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.930
file the datetime functionality.

185
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.530
The name happened to be same,

186
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.650
but this is very common.

187
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.370
It happens.

188
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.570
It's a standard library

189
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.770
that we are bringing in.

190
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.770
Sometimes we go ahead

191
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.450
and say from requests.

192
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.450
This is also a really popular library

193
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.530
for making web requests.

194
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.050
So you simply go ahead and do that.

195
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.450
And sometimes you will say that hey,

196
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.810
I want to have a localized import.

197
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.090
By the way, this is called

198
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.210
as localized import.

199
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.090
So I would say something like

200
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.450
from Chai.

201
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.730
This is a fictitious one.

202
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.090
So Chai Shop, let's just

203
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.850
say.utils I'll show you.

204
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.730
What does it mean?

205
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.490
I want to go ahead and say import

206
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.050
discount and I want to import,

207
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.410
calculate, tax and all these things.

208
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.750
And this might be

209
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.710
a little bit confusing.

210
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.950
Okay, from the Chai Shop

211
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.150
utils, what do you mean by utils?

212
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.550
We haven't seen anything

213
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.310
of this syntax.

214
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.070
We are actually importing from PY Py

215
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.430
to understand this particular

216
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.550
syntax, which you'll see

217
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.710
quite a lot, especially in

218
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.470
the frameworks, we have to actually

219
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.790
design something like this.

220
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.670
So what we're going to do is

221
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.430
let's prepare a structure first.

222
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.430
First I'll walk you through what

223
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.310
structure we are creating,

224
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.830
then we'll create it actually.

225
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.310
So let's just say we have a folder

226
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.460
which says chibe business.

227
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.780
Inside the chai business we

228
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.780
will have a recipe recipes

229
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.220
which will be a folder itself.

230
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.740
I'll denote the folder by having

231
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.260
a trailing slash at the end.

232
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.020
I think that's easier one.

233
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.980
So inside the recipe we are going

234
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.379
to further go ahead and have

235
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.820
let's just say flavor py

236
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.340
and just like we have a recipe we

237
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.900
will have another folder.

238
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.640
We will have utils Just like we saw

239
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.600
this here we will have the utils

240
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.160
again I'll denote trailing slash as

241
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.920
the folder name and then further

242
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.400
inside this we will have discount or

243
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.160
discounts py and at the very outside

244
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
of this we will have a main file

245
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.720
just here.

246
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.920
So main py so this is

247
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.680
what we want to build.

248
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.720
Now I'll show you some very

249
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.600
interesting part about it like inits

250
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.720
and why you should use it.

251
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.680
Why you shouldn't use it

252
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.240
in all of this.

253
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.160
First, let's create this

254
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.400
structure whole thing.

255
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.280
So I'll just close this and instead

256
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.680
of calling this one as just

257
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.320
the chai business, we'll call it as,

258
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.560
06 chai chai business.

259
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.760
It's easier for us.

260
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.280
So 06 underscore.

261
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.040
And let's call this

262
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.720
one as Chai business.

263
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.240
And the first thing that we saw

264
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.440
in here, that I want to create

265
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.200
a new file which is main py.

266
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.280
What we'll write into that,

267
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.720
that comes up a little later.

268
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.320
Not worried much on that.

269
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.990
Let's have a two folder first.

270
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.950
First one being recipes.

271
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.190
Recipe or recipes.

272
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.030
Totally up to you.

273
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.830
And we'll have another folder

274
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.830
which is going to call as utils.

275
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.750
We know in the utils

276
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.710
we have discounts.

277
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.750
Discounts py.

278
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.390
And in the recipe we have flavors.

279
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.150
Flavors Py.

280
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.310
Hope I wrote that correct.

281
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.190
I'm a big type of guy.

282
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.310
So in this flavor py, what we're

283
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.750
doing is let's define some

284
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.550
utilities or some functions for it.

285
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.470
One is this chai.

286
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.670
So we have a lot of Chai

287
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.030
flavors going on in this one.

288
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.150
Feel free to add as many

289
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.070
as you, want to have.

290
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.710
This doesn't print out anything.

291
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.190
Most of the function will return.

292
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.309
Do you want to print it?

293
00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.429
That should be your choice.

294
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:45.150
And chai, is ready.

295
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.790
Ready.

296
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.870
And we'll have another one

297
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.750
which is going to be ginger

298
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.240
Gingerchi, just like that.

299
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.520
And we can have many

300
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.400
hundreds of them.

301
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.640
No problem here.

302
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.560
And we'll say ginger T.

303
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.000
No, ginger chai is ready.

304
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.360
You get the idea what this

305
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.640
flavor is actually doing.

306
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.280
All right, now let's

307
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.760
go ahead and work on.

308
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.360
We'll work on the discounts

309
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.000
a little bit later.

310
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.360
First, let's see how we can actually

311
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.480
bring this into the main py.

312
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.730
So, so notice here in this

313
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.370
I will just go ahead and say import

314
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.090
from the recipes.

315
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.690
I'll just go ahead

316
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.690
and say dot flavor.

317
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.890
That is all I have to do.

318
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.850
So if some files are inside a folder,

319
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.770
all you have to do is name

320
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.730
that folder, then say dot flavors.

321
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.170
No need to add the py

322
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.730
and all of that.

323
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.330
Usually you don't need it,

324
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.170
especially in the Python ecosystem.

325
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.850
That is it.

326
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.890
Now I can just go ahead

327
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.090
and say I want to print

328
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.250
whatever the thing says.

329
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.990
This is like bringing a brook.

330
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.190
So I'll just say, hey,

331
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.070
recipes, flavors dot.

332
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.190
And notice here I have access

333
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.590
to elaichi chai and ginger chai.

334
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.150
So whichever one I want to run, I

335
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.190
can just go ahead and run this.

336
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.070
But I Have to flip the whole book.

337
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.670
That's one other thing.

338
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.590
I can just go ahead

339
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.230
and use another option B.

340
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.630
So we'll comment this out.

341
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.790
You get the import,

342
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.230
we'll just do another import.

343
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.590
So another way of importing this is

344
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.580
from recipes dot flavor.

345
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.100
I can use the named import

346
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.660
and I can say oops, my

347
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.900
bad, this is not import.

348
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.460
This is actually from.

349
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.020
I want to import the method name.

350
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.260
So you can just press control

351
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.260
space and it will give

352
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.580
you suggestions as well.

353
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.539
Elijah.

354
00:10:26.539 --> 00:10:27.740
And you have another one.

355
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.940
There we go.

356
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.300
Now I have the ability

357
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.740
to just print them directly.

358
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.500
So let's just say I want

359
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.500
to call gingerchai.

360
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.340
I can just go ahead

361
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.900
and call Ginger Chai.

362
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.100
This is totally on you.

363
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.590
That how you want to work with this.

364
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.390
Totally on you.

365
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.430
Everything is correct.

366
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.870
There is no right and wrong.

367
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.380
Whichever makes sense.

368
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.110
You can just go ahead

369
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.870
and work with that.

370
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.830
This is named import VS all import.

371
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.230
Now there is another

372
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.230
way of handling this.

373
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.790
Yeah.

374
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.429
So what we can do is we can actually

375
00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:58.230
have a, relative imports as well.

376
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.310
So relative imports are helpful

377
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.270
where the module lives

378
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.870
in the same directory tree.

379
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.590
They're often used

380
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.110
in the packages as well.

381
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.540
So from within the recipe package

382
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.940
you can try something like this.

383
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.740
I'll show you something.

384
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.580
This, this is also interesting.

385
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.900
So notice here I can just go

386
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.100
ahead and say from

387
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.700
dot and notice here I can just go

388
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.930
ahead and say from recipes.

389
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.060
And if the recipe file is within

390
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.620
the same part where the main py

391
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.980
I can just go ahead and say

392
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.780
dot flavors just like this.

393
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.980
But it is not.

394
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.940
So here's the interesting part.

395
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.460
I can use two dots.

396
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.380
That means go one directory back

397
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.700
and it can actually go.

398
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.940
Right now I don't want to go one

399
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.180
directory back because it will

400
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.580
take me onto the root level.

401
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.700
But just wanted to show

402
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.140
you that it exists.

403
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.060
Now here I have to say

404
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.900
the same recipes then I have

405
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.220
to say dot flavors.

406
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.340
It's also a syntax and I can

407
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.420
just go ahead and say import.

408
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.060
Very weird syntax.

409
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.980
But I want to show you that this

410
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.940
actually exists.

411
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.560
Now here's the interesting thing

412
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.800
that usually I say avoid this.

413
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.800
I'll just show you.

414
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.640
But please don't do this.

415
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.120
So let's just say from I

416
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.920
should actually show you.

417
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.800
Not here, actually here because

418
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.480
this is where we are importing.

419
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.960
So what you have to never do

420
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.560
or should actually avoid as

421
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.120
much as possible is from

422
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:22.520
Masalachai import asterisk.

423
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.680
This means I'm importing

424
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.200
everything without knowing

425
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.480
what it's going to do.

426
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.730
What, what it's not going to do.

427
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.450
How is it going to impact the things

428
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.490
and all of these things?

429
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.330
This is something which

430
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.610
is usually avoided.

431
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.690
Now here's the interesting

432
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.930
part I want to show you.

433
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.090
Since we are talking about the

434
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.690
imports, one thing that you have

435
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.730
hundred percent seen is dunder

436
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:48.010
init dunder py now you will see,

437
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.690
almost everybody will say that

438
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.370
the presence of this init py

439
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.360
file turns a folder into a

440
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.120
Python package.

441
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.280
So technically if we are making

442
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.840
a Python package, go into

443
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.000
the recipe, create a new file.

444
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.560
This is underscore, underscore init

445
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.600
in it we don't write anything inside

446
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.040
this file, but this actually turns

447
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.720
folder into a Python package.

448
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.800
It can also contain initialization

449
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.640
code, but this is.

450
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.080
Okay, but here's the interesting

451
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.080
part, what people

452
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.400
don't tell you ever probably

453
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.680
those videos are a bit old.

454
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.960
So anytime that you see Python,

455
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.680
which is about 3.3 or

456
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.920
the Python 3.3 onwards,

457
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.400
you don't have to do this anymore.

458
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.480
But it is still commonly used.

459
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.680
So much so that you're going to

460
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.000
see this and people talk about it.

461
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.160
But the reality is

462
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.480
in the Python 3.3 this is obsolete.

463
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.000
So all the code that you're writing

464
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640
doesn't really need it.

465
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.600
But if you still want

466
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.920
to have it, you can keep it.

467
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.400
There is no right or wrong in this

468
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.100
one, so, so just wanted to make

469
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.220
sure that you understand that.

470
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.460
Okay, this one converts my

471
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.460
folder into the Python modules

472
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.940
and technically now we can call

473
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.060
this one as Recipe modules just

474
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.620
for saying it's already a

475
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.780
module because it's in the

476
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.500
Python structure.

477
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.540
There's a Python files

478
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.300
and all of that.

479
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.900
Python automatically does that,

480
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.740
but still people love to use it.

481
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.220
I don't do it because I know

482
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.580
Python 3.3 doesn't need

483
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.100
this file and anyways this

484
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.580
file is always empty.

485
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.900
This is just for the Python

486
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.940
internal architecture.

487
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.750
You don't do anything with this.

488
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.270
So I hope this all information

489
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.270
was useful for you.

490
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.430
And now from this point

491
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.230
onwards, importing any

492
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.870
file will be your call.

493
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.430
It's not just the guesswork.

494
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.870
You know exactly where I

495
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.510
am going, what I'm doing.

496
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.710
Different types of import,

497
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.710
I'm aware of them.

498
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.509
I know how the named import works,

499
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:32.390
I know how not to do the star

500
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.670
work and everything beyond that.

501
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.070
That is it for this video.

502
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.150
Hope you have enjoyed it.

503
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.870
Do rate us and we'll catch

504
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.870
up in the next video.
