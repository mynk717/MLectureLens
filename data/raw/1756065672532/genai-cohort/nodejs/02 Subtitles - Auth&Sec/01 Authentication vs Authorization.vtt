00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi everyone and welcome

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.160
to brand new section

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.040
on authentication and authorization.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.640
So personally this particular section

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.360
is very exciting and I personally

6
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.080
love this particular section.

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.080
Authentication and authorization

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.640
is a core concept

9
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.240
of any backend system, right?

10
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.560
And sometimes authentication

11
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.160
and authorization can be very

12
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
tricky or hard to understand.

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.450
But, but no worries.

14
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.090
In this particular section we

15
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.970
are going to go step by step.

16
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.010
We are going to understand

17
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.090
each and every bit of authentication

18
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.210
and authorization and how

19
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.330
in Node js we can build a secure

20
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.250
authentication workflow.

21
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.850
So in this particular video,

22
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.290
let's first understand the meaning

23
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.250
of these two words that how

24
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.570
authentication and authorization

25
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.180
are two different things.

26
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.820
Okay, so here we are talking

27
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.540
about authentication, which

28
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.100
is our first word, right?

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.660
That is authentication.

30
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660
And secondly we have authorization.

31
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.540
Now knowing the difference between

32
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.780
these two things is very important.

33
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.660
Okay, so let's first understand

34
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.820
what is authentication, right?

35
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.500
Authentication basically

36
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.300
means that who are you?

37
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.140
In simple terms,

38
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.540
authentication means who are you?

39
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.420
Do I know you?

40
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.860
That is an authentication.

41
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.700
Okay, so which means like

42
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.480
for example, if you go on

43
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.440
to facebook.com, right?

44
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320
If you are not logged in, you are

45
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.320
welcomed with a login screen.

46
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.880
Okay?

47
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.040
So whenever you open facebook.com

48
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.760
if you are not logged in, you are

49
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.920
welcomed with a login screen.

50
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.879
For example, if I open a new

51
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.080
tab and I go onto facebook.com

52
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.280
so what you will notice is

53
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.840
see, I am viewing this page.

54
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.640
That is a, login page.

55
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.280
Why am I seeing this page?

56
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.720
Because I am not authenticated.

57
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.600
The server is not able

58
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.000
to recognize me.

59
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120
So that means let's say if we

60
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.560
have a server here, okay?

61
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
So let's say this is our server.

62
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.080
This is the Facebook

63
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.760
server, not my server.

64
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.680
So what is basically

65
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.520
happening here is the server

66
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.119
and I am a user, right?

67
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.880
So let's say here is the user.

68
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.800
So this user that is me, I

69
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.320
made a request to the server

70
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.600
and server says hey, I don't

71
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.170
know who are you, right?

72
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.970
It is not able to recognize me.

73
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.330
And that is the reason the response

74
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.450
from the server was a slash

75
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930
login page, which is nice.

76
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.690
Now the thing is, this particular

77
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.610
thing means that this particular

78
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.450
user is not authenticated,

79
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.250
server is not able to recognize me.

80
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.050
On the other hand, let's say if I

81
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.650
am logged in, okay, so if I give

82
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.590
him my email and password and

83
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.550
somehow I am logged in, that

84
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.630
means that if I send a request to

85
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.150
the server in, instead of getting

86
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.990
a login screen, what I, what do I

87
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.150
get?

88
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
I get basically all my feed, okay?

89
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.630
I get feed posts, I get

90
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.950
all my friend requests, I

91
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.950
get all that data, right?

92
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.510
I am able to get my data

93
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.830
so that is what that means.

94
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.030
I am authenticated.

95
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.790
I am authenticated.

96
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.670
That means server is able

97
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.070
to recognize me that,

98
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.150
oh, this is Piyush Garg.

99
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.870
And based on who am I Based on like

100
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.120
my id, like, let's say Piyushkar.

101
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.640
It is sending me the post

102
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.000
that is relevant to me.

103
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.320
It is sending me the friend

104
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.040
request that are being sent to me.

105
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.880
It is sending me my messages,

106
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.160
my messenger, my

107
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.400
groups, everything, mine.

108
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.760
Okay, so this is

109
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.880
basically authentication.

110
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.400
That means whether you are logged

111
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.320
in or not, if you are authenticated,

112
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.960
okay, you are an authentic person.

113
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.160
I know who are you?

114
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.560
But what is this?

115
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.480
Authorization.

116
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.160
So authorization is basically

117
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.000
the next step of the authentication.

118
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.990
Authorization says that it.

119
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.390
It assumes that you are

120
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.110
already authenticated.

121
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.390
But are you authorized?

122
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.270
Are you authorized?

123
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.470
Okay.

124
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.950
To this resource?

125
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.270
Okay, now what does this mean?

126
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.430
I'll just give you an example

127
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.910
and everything will be super clear.

128
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.390
Let's say this is your college.

129
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.830
Okay?

130
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.270
This is your XYZ college.

131
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.470
Okay, that's good.

132
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.590
Now, first thing is,

133
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.830
can a random person.

134
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.790
Okay, let's say here

135
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.230
is a random person.

136
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.250
Can a random person enter,

137
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.649
the campus of the college?

138
00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.970
No.

139
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.450
Right?

140
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.810
Why?

141
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.890
Because there is a security

142
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.730
guard sitting here.

143
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.450
So let's say that this

144
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.850
is your security guard.

145
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.130
So this security guard, whenever

146
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.730
you try to enter, you are not.

147
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.850
You are not allowed to enter because

148
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.610
he doesn't recognize you, right?

149
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.130
You are just a random person.

150
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.450
You have no ID card.

151
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.010
You don't have any kind of thing,

152
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.090
so you are not allowed.

153
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.130
That means you are not authenticated.

154
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.210
So your authentication failed.

155
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.730
But let's say you had.

156
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.130
You have taken the admission

157
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.970
in this college.

158
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.810
And in return, college has given

159
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.950
you something known as an ID card.

160
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.950
So whenever you go, you

161
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.070
submit your fees, right?

162
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.790
You pay your fees

163
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.870
and you get admission.

164
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.950
You are given an ID card.

165
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.910
Nice.

166
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.870
Now, this ID card, which is

167
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.750
issued by this XYZ college.

168
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.350
Now you take this ID card.

169
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.510
Now you as a person, go back

170
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.270
to the security guard.

171
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.950
Show your ID card.

172
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.190
Now you are authenticated.

173
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.230
Should this security, guard allow you

174
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.110
to enter the college?

175
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.510
Yes.

176
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.870
Why?

177
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.800
Because you were authenticated.

178
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.240
Nice.

179
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.040
Now, let's say this is print.

180
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.080
This is your classroom.

181
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.440
Okay?

182
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.880
So let's say this is your classroom.

183
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.640
So I'll just draw it in this way.

184
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.160
And, let's say this is

185
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.680
some internal staff room.

186
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.080
Okay?

187
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.480
So let's say this is the staff room

188
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.320
or principal's room or some kind

189
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.880
of internal room in your college.

190
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.400
So I'll just make it green.

191
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.120
Now, based on this ID card

192
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.480
and you are a student, can you Enter

193
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.480
this particular class?

194
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.400
Yes, you can enter.

195
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.600
Because that particular class

196
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.760
is meant for you, right?

197
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.440
That's a class.

198
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.780
You can enter it.

199
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.580
But with this ID card and this thing,

200
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.780
can you enter in the staff room?

201
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.740
No, right?

202
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.220
Why?

203
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.700
Because again, there will be one

204
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.180
more security guard, let's say

205
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.980
in front of the staff room.

206
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.140
But to enter here,

207
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.820
to enter here, you are not allowed.

208
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.300
Why?

209
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.900
Because your ID card says

210
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.340
that you are a student.

211
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.620
And as a student, you are not allowed

212
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.860
to enter the staff room.

213
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.300
But on the other hand, let's

214
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.660
say one more teacher is there.

215
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.140
Okay?

216
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.940
Now, teachers also

217
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.940
have their ID cards.

218
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.380
But this ID card holds

219
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.440
an authority of a teacher.

220
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.280
Okay, Of a teacher.

221
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.720
Now first of all, tell me,

222
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.400
should this particular person be

223
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.960
allowed inside the campus?

224
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.240
Yes, because they have an ID

225
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.960
card, they are authenticated.

226
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.880
Now, when they come here, this

227
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.200
person will check that, Hey, I

228
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.600
know that you are already a part

229
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.040
of this college, because if you

230
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.600
were not a part of this college,

231
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.200
anyway, you cannot bypass this

232
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.600
gate.

233
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.400
But now I have to check whether

234
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.360
you have authority

235
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.200
to enter the staff room or not.

236
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.800
So it will.

237
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.400
So this security guard will check.

238
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.960
Oh, I see that you are a teacher.

239
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.480
Your role is a teacher.

240
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.140
So I think you are allowed.

241
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.540
So this particular teacher

242
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.860
can go into the staff room,

243
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.620
but not this ID card.

244
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.820
So this is basically

245
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.380
authorization, okay?

246
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.420
That are you authorized

247
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.180
to this particular resource?

248
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.940
So authorized is the word here.

249
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.660
Okay?

250
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.300
So that means for authorization,

251
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.220
you have to be authenticated.

252
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.580
This is simple, right?

253
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.540
Because for authorization to work,

254
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.260
you should be authenticated.

255
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.180
Authenticated means

256
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.420
you are logged in.

257
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.180
The server knows who are you, right?

258
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.260
You have some kind of ID card.

259
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.540
But authorization means.

260
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.540
Authorization basically

261
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.540
means are you allowed to access

262
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.780
that resource or not?

263
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.100
Got it.

264
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.900
Now if I log into Facebook,

265
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.620
I am authenticated.

266
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.540
But can I access your friends?

267
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.180
Can I accept a friend

268
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.900
request that is sent to you?

269
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.940
Of course not, because I don't have

270
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.180
authenticity, I don't have

271
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.900
that authorization to accept

272
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.410
a friend request or on your behalf.

273
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:42.930
Got it?

274
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.050
Now can I change your password?

275
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.290
No, because I am not

276
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.770
authorized to do it.

277
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.690
So that is, your authorization.

278
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.730
So I hope the difference

279
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.810
between authentication

280
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.130
and authorization is clear.

281
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.130
So first step will be

282
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.210
authentication, understanding

283
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.410
authentication and everything.

284
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.770
Authorization is very

285
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.770
simple, to be honest.

286
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.090
Once authentication is clear,

287
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.330
authorization is nothing.

288
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.210
It's just a check.

289
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.810
Okay?

290
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.330
The main challenge, the main

291
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.050
security comes in the authentication

292
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.410
which we are going to cover

293
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.730
in the upcoming videos.
