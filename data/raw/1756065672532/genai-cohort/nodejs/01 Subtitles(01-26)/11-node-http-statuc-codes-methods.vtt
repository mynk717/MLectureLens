00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.560
Right, so now you have understood

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.200
that what a server does.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.080
Now as a backend developer,

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.760
what's our duty that we have

5
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.800
to create this server?

6
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.680
We have to create a machine

7
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.880
which is able to handle

8
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.200
the incoming request, right?

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720
You should be able to accept

10
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.000
the incoming request,

11
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.720
do some magical stuff on it

12
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.120
and send back a response.

13
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.120
So this is what we have to do.

14
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.680
Now there is one thing that

15
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.260
I'll be using a lot

16
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.800
while we are in this course, that

17
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.160
is these kind of diagrams.

18
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.100
Okay, so, so what we are going to do

19
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100
is, so in order to represent that,

20
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.100
how, how the request response cycle

21
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.300
was done, so we construct two lines.

22
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.940
So this first line is for

23
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.500
the client, let's say like

24
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.180
we can name it as client.

25
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.900
The second line is let's say

26
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.260
for the what do you call server?

27
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Okay, they can be third line

28
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.500
for database and all.

29
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.580
So what we can do is we can

30
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.060
represent it in this way.

31
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.140
So let's say client

32
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.930
sends a request right now, now

33
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.210
server processes the request.

34
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.850
So let's say that it took five

35
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.650
seconds, okay, it took five seconds.

36
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.730
So let's say five seconds

37
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.250
request, it took.

38
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.690
And after five seconds what you

39
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.250
can do is you can return,

40
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.250
you can return back the response.

41
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.370
So you can just read, you

42
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.530
can just name it as, hey,

43
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.850
there was a request, right?

44
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.690
So there was a request

45
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.530
made by the client.

46
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.800
Okay, you took five

47
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.200
seconds to process it.

48
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.960
Then, then you sent

49
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.040
back the response.

50
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.880
Okay, so you here

51
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.760
sent back the response.

52
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
That is whatever client needed.

53
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.760
And then this response, this request

54
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.800
response cycle was terminated here.

55
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.080
So basically client

56
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.120
closes the connection.

57
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120
So client closed

58
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.640
the connection because you know,

59
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.210
this one cycle is completed.

60
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.570
So if client needs something it can

61
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.970
again send a request and response

62
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.130
and the cycle continues.

63
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.290
So this is where the client

64
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.850
actually close the connection.

65
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.490
Okay.

66
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.810
And yeah, there is a possibility

67
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.090
that client can even keep

68
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.530
the connection open that is

69
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.890
known as server sent events.

70
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.290
So yeah, don't worry about that.

71
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.050
Okay, so this diagram helps us

72
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.970
to visualize that

73
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.090
what exactly happened.

74
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.090
Okay, so these kind

75
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.090
of diagrams you will see a lot if

76
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.330
you are into system design

77
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.169
or something like that.

78
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.490
But yeah, again, again it's

79
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.850
a high level because it's

80
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.130
a beginner friendly course.

81
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.490
So I don't just want to,

82
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.250
you know, confuse you.

83
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.650
So I hope you are getting it now

84
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.050
with this knowledge, with this

85
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.970
knowledge there is little bit more

86
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.250
that you need to understand.

87
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.290
Okay.

88
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.010
Number one, when we talk

89
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.650
about this HTTP thing, okay, so

90
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.050
in HTTP you have to understand

91
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.850
that there is something

92
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.090
known as HTTP methods, okay.

93
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.250
Which includes like you have

94
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.530
a Get method, you have a post

95
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.970
method, you have a put method,

96
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.320
you have a path patch

97
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.240
method, you have a delete method.

98
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.000
So there are some methods

99
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.160
and there are something known

100
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.480
as HTTP status codes, which

101
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000
includes one of the famous

102
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.440
RS404 which says not found.

103
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.880
So there are a lot of status codes

104
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.760
that you have to understand.

105
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.960
So a good API or a good backend

106
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.720
should follow these rules.

107
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.680
Okay?

108
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.920
So let's cover them one by one.

109
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.870
First is the HTTP methods, right?

110
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.950
What are, what are HTTP methods?

111
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.870
See, when a client

112
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.190
sends a request, right?

113
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.070
This request has something

114
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.590
known as HTTP method, okay?

115
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.950
It has some method attached to it.

116
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.230
For example, there can be a request

117
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.030
of get type, there can be a request

118
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.150
of post type, there can be a request

119
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.710
of delete type and all that.

120
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.590
If client wants to get some data

121
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.830
from the server, the client

122
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.670
should send a get request.

123
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.270
So get request is made when, when

124
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.789
client, when client want to read

125
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.790
some data or to get some data

126
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.910
to get some data from the server.

127
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.510
So this is where you make a get

128
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.820
request post when client want

129
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.740
to send some data to server.

130
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.020
So let me give you an example.

131
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.900
Okay, so for the first example that

132
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.080
is the get, let's say you want to

133
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.860
see all the tweets, See all the

134
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.180
tweets, or you want to Var a video,

135
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.029
or you want to see comments on a

136
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.740
video.

137
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.820
These all are what, these

138
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.020
all are get requests.

139
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.980
Because you can see that

140
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.290
these requests is something

141
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.890
like that you want to get something

142
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.890
from the server.

143
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.330
Post examples for post, it

144
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.130
can be like you want to create

145
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.250
a tweet, you want to upload

146
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.250
a video, upload a video.

147
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.410
Or it can be like, you know, you

148
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.770
create a comment,

149
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.410
you comment below this video that is

150
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.330
going to be a post request,

151
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.610
you create a new comment.

152
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.690
So these all are what,

153
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.170
these are post requests.

154
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.570
Now similar to this, similar

155
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.690
to this, you have something

156
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.170
known as patch request.

157
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.250
Patch is basically when,

158
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.410
okay, when client wants

159
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.050
to update, some existing data.

160
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.490
So when you have some existing data

161
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.010
and you want to update it, you can

162
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.370
send a patch request and delete.

163
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.530
When client wants to delete some

164
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.010
data, okay, to delete some data.

165
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.690
So whenever client makes a request

166
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.290
to the server, this request can

167
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.930
be a get request, a post request,

168
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.540
delete request, patch request.

169
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.620
So there is a request.

170
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.700
Okay, so these are the HTTP methods.

171
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.540
These all are what,

172
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.340
these are HTTP methods.

173
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.180
Get, post, delete, patch, put.

174
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.780
Okay, then, then there is something

175
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.900
known as HTTP status codes.

176
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.460
Now these were request, okay,

177
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.220
these, these things that we just

178
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.060
discussed this was related to the

179
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.300
request that when client sends the

180
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.760
request, this particular thing is,

181
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.560
is taken into the consideration

182
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.600
right now.

183
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.680
This part is fine.

184
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.680
This part is relatively very easy.

185
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.640
I know, Just one second.

186
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.040
My OCD is kicking in.

187
00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.480
Yeah.

188
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.720
Now when you send a response, okay,

189
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.600
now when you send a response back,

190
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.160
the server sends some status code.

191
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.640
Status code is nothing

192
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.210
but just a number.

193
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.410
Okay, these are nothing, but these

194
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.690
are some bunch of numbers.

195
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.450
So I'll tell you what

196
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.370
these numbers means.

197
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.730
So while sending back the

198
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.690
response, the server can say

199
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.850
for example, Hey, 404, which

200
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.130
basically tells the client that

201
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.730
hey, the thing that you are

202
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.089
trying to access does not

203
00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.250
exist, not found.

204
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.450
It can be a 500 internal server

205
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.090
error, it can be a 200.

206
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.690
That means everything is okay.

207
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.890
It can be a 401 that is unauthorized.

208
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.330
It can be a four or three.

209
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.880
It can be it can be of,

210
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.800
let's say 501.

211
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.960
It can be a 201.

212
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.080
So server is basically sending some

213
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.880
kind of numeric data to indicate

214
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.720
what kind of response it is.

215
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.800
So this status code is used

216
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.800
to tell what kind of response it is.

217
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.840
Okay, so it can be like

218
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.280
a successful response, it

219
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.760
can be an error response.

220
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.090
What kind of error is that?

221
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.320
It can be a redirect thing.

222
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.200
So that thing.

223
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.760
Okay, so let me give

224
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.960
you a few examples.

225
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.360
For example, if backend sends 200,

226
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.360
this means everything was okay.

227
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.800
If backend sends 211, it means it

228
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.320
was okay and something is created.

229
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.360
You created some resource

230
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.160
on the server.

231
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.240
If server sends 400, that

232
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.320
means it's a bad request.

233
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.160
It's a bad request.

234
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.080
So that means your request was bad.

235
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.080
If it sends a 404 it means

236
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.080
not found that something.

237
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.040
If it sends 500 it means that

238
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.270
there is some server error.

239
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.630
Server error, that server

240
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.510
there, there is something

241
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.790
wrong with the server.

242
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.270
So these are some status

243
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.590
codes which we use commonly.

244
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.670
And there is even more.

245
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.190
Like for example, there is a 301

246
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.470
that is for a redirect.

247
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.230
Okay, that is for a redirect.

248
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.870
So let me show you all the status

249
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.630
codes that are there.

250
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.270
So just search for HTTP status codes.

251
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.510
Okay, so HTTP status codes.

252
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.270
So you can see that it ranges

253
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.990
from 100 to all the way to 599.

254
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.750
Now if a status code starts with 1,

255
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.950
okay, now this is very important.

256
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.790
If a status code starts with one like

257
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.750
111-1111103 this basically means

258
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.870
it's an informational response.

259
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.830
Okay, so this is first thing.

260
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.830
Second, if it starts with 2.

261
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.870
So like that is from 200 to 299.

262
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.030
If it starts with 2 2,

263
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.549
so 2xx, this basically means

264
00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.750
it's a success response.

265
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.150
Okay, then if it starts

266
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.830
with three, if it starts

267
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.830
with three, it's a redirect.

268
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.909
Just one second.

269
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.990
Yeah, so if it starts with

270
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.630
3xx, it's a redirect.

271
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.630
Let's say server wants

272
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.190
to redirect you to somewhere.

273
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.310
If it starts with four, it basically

274
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.190
means it's a client error.

275
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.950
That means you are doing some error

276
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.950
four or four not found.

277
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:58.990
You are trying to access

278
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.310
something that is not existing.

279
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.630
And if it starts with 5,

280
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.270
it's a server error.

281
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.790
So these are the response codes

282
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.510
that we are going to see.

283
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.190
So you can see that hey, these

284
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.270
two are starting with four, right?

285
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.910
So this, this basically indicates

286
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.030
that it's a client error.

287
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.910
This 500 starts with 5.

288
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.190
This is a server error.

289
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.230
This 200.

290
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.710
These both starts with 200.

291
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.550
This means these are

292
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.870
successful responses.

293
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.270
So this is how the server sends

294
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.750
an appropriate status code, which

295
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.230
of course as a developer you have

296
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.750
to set to tell the client that

297
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.150
what kind of response this is.

298
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.710
Okay, so these are your

299
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.430
response mechanisms.

300
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.669
So client sends a request along with

301
00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:41.350
a HTTP method and you process it.

302
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.910
And while sending the response

303
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.030
you have to set a number, a code

304
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.390
which tells the client that

305
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.710
what kind of request is that?

306
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.350
Okay.
