00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.520
These days softwares

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.760
are very compatible.

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.720
You don't have to worry

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.800
about Mac or Windows too much.

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.960
But still, just for the sake of

6
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.360
having it, I will walk you through

7
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.480
that how you can install and run

8
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
Python programs on Windows as well.

9
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.800
Again there are two ways

10
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.280
of writing Python programs.

11
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.440
One in the shell itself,

12
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
another one is into file so that

13
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.600
we can save them forever.

14
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.760
And obviously the second

15
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.320
method is really good.

16
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.640
So let me just take you onto

17
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.760
a Windows screen and walk you

18
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.640
through that how you can

19
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.320
actually have a Python program

20
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.760
being installed as well as run

21
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.090
your very first fil file.

22
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.010
And it's exactly same as if you

23
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.250
have watched it on the Mac or

24
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.090
probably if you have skipped

25
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.250
it, you should really Var it.

26
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.730
It's a great way and probably

27
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.850
you'll learn a thing or two.

28
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.570
Anyways, if you don't want

29
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.970
to do that, that's totally okay.

30
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.370
Now I am on a Windows

31
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.850
machine and together we're

32
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.730
going to go through.

33
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.050
So just go ahead and fire up

34
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.610
any browser of your choice and go

35
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.650
ahead and have it for me.

36
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.170
I just use the default version

37
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930
and I will just go ahead and use

38
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.300
python.org to download the Python.

39
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.500
Now apart from this I will

40
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.740
also use one more website

41
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.900
to download the VS code.

42
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
This is my choice of editor

43
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380
and I prefer to use it instead

44
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.700
of others just for the sake of.

45
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.260
It's good, it's really nice

46
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.259
and I enjoy writing code in VS

47
00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.220
code so that's why I use it.

48
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.340
Just download it for Windows.

49
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.340
Simple installation,

50
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.220
nothing big deal.

51
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.420
No big deal there.

52
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.580
Now once you go onto the python.org

53
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.300
what we can do is we can click on

54
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.030
download and just download the

55
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.550
version whichever version you want

56
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.390
to have with and usually it detects

57
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390
the system whichever you are on and

58
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.910
it gives you appropriate version

59
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.190
for it.

60
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.630
But in case not you can always click

61
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.990
on the download and look

62
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.430
for the version you are looking for.

63
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.870
In my case it is Windows.

64
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.670
So all the things you can see

65
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.950
specific version of Windows I

66
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.510
recommend to choose the latest one.

67
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.150
But you can click on Windows or

68
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.750
Linux or Mac and can choose that.

69
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.550
Hey, I want this specific version

70
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.590
of the Windows so you can

71
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.030
see there's lots of installers

72
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.230
and things available for you.

73
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.530
Usually the default installer

74
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.850
which is next next I agree

75
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.570
one is usually the best one.

76
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.370
You can just go ahead

77
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.610
and install this one.

78
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.690
I have got one here on my desktop.

79
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.050
It doesn't look like it's the file

80
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.810
but hey this is my virtual machine

81
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.408
so just bear with me.

82
00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:11.770
Now once you click on this it

83
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.970
says, hey, install the Python

84
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.090
where you want to install it.

85
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.490
The first thing I would love to add

86
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.810
a path so that I don't have to

87
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.570
manually go ahead and add the path.

88
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140
I can just use it and, and use

89
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.420
the admin privileges when

90
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.380
installing the Python.

91
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.140
So you can just go ahead and use

92
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140
it wherever you like so it

93
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.260
doesn't really bother much.

94
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.500
So I just happen to click on

95
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.540
the admin privileges when installing

96
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.860
so that it can be simply used.

97
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.620
Click on install now and it just

98
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.300
includes and install everything

99
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.100
and allow this app to make changes.

100
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.500
Yes, please go ahead

101
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.340
and install this.

102
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.620
And once you go ahead

103
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.100
and install this, this should

104
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.980
take fairly less time.

105
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.020
And apart from this I also as I

106
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.900
mentioned in my Mac video as well,

107
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.580
I actually don't use the default

108
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.380
terminal or the command prompt

109
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.900
from either the Mac or Windows.

110
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.260
I happen to use one another software

111
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.900
which I really love.

112
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.020
Feel free to use it, Feel free

113
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.860
to ignore it, feel free

114
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.220
to use the original terminal,

115
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.700
but I happen to just use it.

116
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.380
I just love it.

117
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.380
It's available on Mac,

118
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.740
Windows and Linux, so I

119
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.700
just happen to use it.

120
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.100
So just thought to mention it

121
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.980
now apart from this, once it's

122
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.140
installed, which is taking a little

123
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.060
time and let's wait for it

124
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.620
and let's wait for it to finish.

125
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.460
All right, since it's a Windows

126
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.660
you will see these kinds

127
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.940
of things that sometimes the path

128
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.980
is too long and all of that.

129
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.420
So we'll just disable the length

130
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.420
and yes, just allow it so that

131
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.980
sometimes the path where

132
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.460
the Python install is too long.

133
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.700
So Windows has its own default

134
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.060
configuration so we can just close

135
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.180
it now once we have it, I can just

136
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.900
go ahead and open up any terminal.

137
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.660
In this case I will use Warp

138
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.900
and I'll open up a new shell

139
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.820
of Warp and so I'll just open this

140
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.980
up and I'll start a fresh one.

141
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.380
So this is a new shell that I've

142
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.580
installed and here I can just

143
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.820
go ahead and type Python and then

144
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.140
I can say version and hopefully

145
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.020
this will give me that.

146
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.060
Hey, Python is installed

147
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.060
on your system.

148
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.740
I'll just zoom this a little bit.

149
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.100
Oops to zoom.

150
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.020
Shouldn't have done that,

151
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.620
but anyways, let me fix this.

152
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.580
Anyways let's go up here.

153
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.940
So now that we can see that we

154
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.910
have Python 3.13.2, any version

155
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.110
that you have installed and as

156
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.269
long as this command is giving

157
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.790
you an output that means we are

158
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.149
all okay, we can just get

159
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.230
started working with that now on

160
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.750
your desktop.

161
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.950
Just go ahead and create A new

162
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.750
folder, wherever you like.

163
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.550
So I'll just go ahead

164
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.710
and say new, folder.

165
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.390
I'm going to call this

166
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.190
one as Test Win.

167
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.390
Because anyways, I'm going

168
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.390
to go ahead and delete this

169
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.790
after this recording

170
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.150
and I'll just close this one.

171
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.430
I'll fire up my VS code, in the.

172
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.600
So once I have this, I'll just

173
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.240
go ahead and say that, hey, let's

174
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.080
go ahead and minimize this.

175
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.280
And now just go ahead and drag

176
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.920
and drop this Test Win.

177
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.720
And as soon as you drag and drop

178
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.680
this, yes, I do trust the author,

179
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.040
because I am the author.

180
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.880
And just click on this new folder.

181
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.400
We're going to call

182
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.080
this one as 01basics.

183
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.080
And inside this we're going

184
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.560
to create our new first file,

185
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.600
which is going to call this

186
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.280
one as Python Test document.

187
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.710
The extension PY is really important.

188
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.670
Once you have this, this

189
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.550
might prompt that.

190
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.510
Hey, do you want to install

191
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.550
some Python extension?

192
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.830
Yes, I would love to install

193
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.990
it because it will help me

194
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.390
to get suggestions so that

195
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.110
I can just write faster.

196
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.870
Just like Python has.

197
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.950
Every language has these

198
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.510
suggestions so that you can write

199
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.950
your language faster.

200
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.510
It's taking a little bit while to

201
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.190
install this and in case you're

202
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.670
wondering, I do have a theme

203
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.350
installed on my VS code, which is

204
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.060
known as chai theme and which

205
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.140
makes the code look a little bit

206
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.700
better.

207
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.060
So that's why I use it.

208
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.780
Once you have this

209
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.820
installed, that's it.

210
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.140
It's an official extension

211
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.940
by Microsoft.

212
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.260
So I can just go ahead and close

213
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.300
this, close this, close this,

214
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.780
come back to your code, click

215
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.820
on this icon so that you can

216
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.180
see all of the code files.

217
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.780
And now I'm going to go ahead

218
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.300
and just again, this, not this.

219
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.860
I just wanted to open the font

220
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.140
size editor so that I can

221
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.130
have some bigger font

222
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.850
and hopefully that will help you

223
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.730
to see the code much easier.

224
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.410
On my Mac it's much easier.

225
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.890
I can just go ahead and say import

226
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.450
sys, just like we have been writing

227
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.690
it on the very first installation.

228
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.370
This is just importing some system

229
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.730
libraries, with the Python and now

230
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.130
you can just ask it that, hey, just

231
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.650
go ahead and print sys and as soon

232
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.970
as I put up a dot you can see we

233
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.570
have so much things to learn about

234
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.010
it.

235
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.410
And as of now I just want

236
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.810
to have the version that is it.

237
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.210
It's going to give me some output.

238
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.540
But this is really what I want now.

239
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.940
I want to open up the terminal

240
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.340
and the easiest shortcut

241
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.820
for that is command and tilde.

242
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.300
The tilde is the key just

243
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.300
below your escape key.

244
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.540
And here I can just go ahead

245
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.580
and say, hey, Python, I just want

246
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.780
to run this file,

247
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.540
which is inside the 01, the basics

248
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.100
and inside this Python test.

249
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.860
As soon as I run this file, it

250
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.460
says, hey, this is the expected

251
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.540
output, this is what we have,

252
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.980
and as long as you are able to

253
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.260
run this, that means, hey, it's

254
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.740
all good.

255
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.100
Now we have all the things

256
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.910
up and ready and, and we can see

257
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.390
everything is working fine.

258
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.910
Absolutely.

259
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.750
On Windows, this is exactly

260
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.070
the same thing that we had

261
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.030
done on the Mac as well.

262
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.750
And I highly recommend you to Var

263
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.470
that video as well, so that you can

264
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.350
see how intercompatible this is.

265
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.150
You don't have to worry

266
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.070
about anything, it just

267
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.310
works out of the box.

268
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.830
The same instruction are on Mac,

269
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.350
the same instruction are on Windows.

270
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.670
The only difference is

271
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.550
in the path, that is it.

272
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.220
So in the Windows it is,

273
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.030
forward slashes, in the Mac it's

274
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.510
the backslashes that is it.

275
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.350
Apart from that, no

276
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.190
difference at all.

277
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.440
So this is good.

278
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.760
We have done the installation

279
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.000
as well as have run the first,

280
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.600
decent, Python code.

281
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.480
It's not a hello world, but it's

282
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.720
definitely a good one and we

283
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.440
have done it all awesomely.

284
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.420
So that is it.

285
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.800
We are now compatible with

286
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.760
the installation as well as

287
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.600
running the first command.

288
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.560
We have a good foundation

289
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.000
of knowing the Python as well.

290
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.400
And from the next video onwards

291
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.600
we can start writing some good

292
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.200
amount of Python code, have some

293
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.760
ground basics and the knowledge

294
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.000
behind the scene of Python.

295
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.680
It's all fun.

296
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.040
Let's go ahead and get started

297
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.160
with Python.
