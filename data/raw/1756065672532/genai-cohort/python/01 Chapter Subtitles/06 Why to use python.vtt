1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.600
All right, so continuing further

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.040
from the last video which says, hey,

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.600
why do you want to learn Python?

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920
The easiest answer would be

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.040
because it's easy.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.800
That is why I want to learn it.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.760
And most, for most

8
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.080
of the people it is actually true.

9
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.520
And I also started with Python

10
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.960
because it was super easy to learn

11
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.640
and eventually I switched to other

12
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.360
languages which I also enjoy.

13
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.480
But still I come back onto

14
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.000
the Python every now and then.

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So the first reason that

16
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you want to learn about it

17
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.030
is it's really portable.

18
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.550
Yeah, once the program is being

19
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.150
written in the Python they can

20
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.110
actually go ahead and run on variety

21
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.430
of operating system including

22
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.910
Windows, Mac and everybody's

23
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.950
favorite Linux as well.

24
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.910
So there is no such thing as

25
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.870
hey, I've written this,

26
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.030
you need exact same system.

27
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.430
No, it's not like that.

28
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.990
Once it's being written it can

29
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.790
be used on anywhere at all.

30
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.230
That's the first major

31
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.190
advantage of it.

32
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.110
Also another example is Python is

33
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.090
very, very readable and it's

34
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.490
super easy to guess what things

35
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.130
are doing, as long as you

36
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.650
maintain some form of readability

37
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.410
in your code as well, but it's

38
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.330
fairly readable.

39
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.250
Whatever you are doing, it's very

40
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.330
kind of predictable.

41
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.570
And I like predictability.

42
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.010
And one of the major reason why

43
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.810
this language even was invented

44
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.570
is for productive reasons.

45
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.210
Writing code in Java and C

46
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.450
definitely could be a little bit

47
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.530
faster, you can do the same

48
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.730
task but you can also do

49
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.970
the same task in Python as well.

50
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.720
Almost same, almost all task and it's

51
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.000
meant to be productive, friendly.

52
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
Python and Java code

53
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.320
looks too verbose.

54
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.480
There is a steep learning

55
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.400
curve for that.

56
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.560
But Python you can pick it

57
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.880
up pretty quickly.

58
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.800
Within a week you can pick

59
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.200
up decent Python.

60
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880
And that is one of the reason,

61
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.840
other reason why everybody love

62
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.920
this is something known as

63
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.000
STL or I will call this one as

64
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.880
easier one standard library.

65
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.320
What do you mean by standard library?

66
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.870
A lot of code is already being

67
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.230
written in the Python and people

68
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.470
are very generous that they

69
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.870
have open sourced their code.

70
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.310
That means those codes are available

71
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.470
for you even to use commercially.

72
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.750
And that is the reason, one of

73
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.950
the reason why it's getting popular

74
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.030
in the world of data science

75
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.710
and machine learning and AI.

76
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.870
Hundreds, probably not hundred

77
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.830
millions of people have

78
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.150
written the code and made it

79
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.509
available for people, hey, go

80
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.990
ahead and use it for free.

81
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.830
And this huge standard library,

82
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.960
availability of the code built

83
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.560
in tools is the reason why

84
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.600
everybody loves and we will

85
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.480
learn a lot about pre built

86
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800
libraries and we just import

87
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.520
these code.

88
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.880
It's like moving up here so

89
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.680
somebody has created this class.

90
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.800
All I got to do is bring up this part

91
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.040
of it and now I can use it.

92
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.440
I am commercially allowed to use

93
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.800
this piece of code from somebody

94
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.680
else's code that makes it

95
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.200
super powerful as a language.

96
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.640
So this is the beauty of it.

97
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.760
Now apart from this, this

98
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.280
language is actually

99
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.480
pretty flexible and multi use.

100
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.120
So I'll call this one as multi use.

101
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.830
So Python a lot of people

102
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.190
think is just terminal or

103
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.110
just for data science.

104
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.910
But no, it can actually use

105
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.710
for a lot of web apps.

106
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.710
Yes, you can build full

107
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.830
stack application with it.

108
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.430
We use it actually in that majorly.

109
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.150
We can do a lot of automation stuff.

110
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.710
We can do a lot of data science,

111
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.270
data manipulation, CSVs,

112
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.670
even for machine learning AI.

113
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.750
It's really a lot and my most

114
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.870
important reason is most favorite is

115
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.480
I call this one as

116
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.600
simply Chai level happiness.

117
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.600
So yeah, this language is super

118
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.560
amazing to learn and you enjoy

119
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.240
every bit of writing of it and I'll

120
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.360
make sure that you actually

121
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.040
go through with each part of it.

122
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.800
So this whole thing is at one place.

123
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.400
But this is my reason for using.

124
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.200
It's a Chai level happiness

125
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.800
that you get through writing

126
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.880
the code for this language.

127
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.680
And I will show you some of my

128
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.840
neat tricks and my super easy

129
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.280
scripts that I use still

130
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.480
to this date and every day

131
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.970
to do some of my regular tasks.

132
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.770
So these are my reason why I use

133
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.650
Python and I'm pretty sure you

134
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.290
will also leave some of your reason

135
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.930
to learn the Python or enjoy

136
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.570
the Python or write the Python.

137
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.530
Please do tweet me out.

138
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.810
I would love to know your reason

139
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.370
why you are using Python

140
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.930
or you want to learn Python.

141
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.010
Probably it will help me

142
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.090
to improve to make these

143
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.450
kinds of videos as well.

144
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.050
Let's catch up in the next video.
