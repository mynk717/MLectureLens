1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.680
Next up, we're going to take sets.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.080
And sets are super easy in Python.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.840
No need to overcomplicate them.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.160
I have seen a lot of people

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.240
who complicate them.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.400
These are known as set or

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.360
sets, whatever you want

8
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.840
to call them, no big deal.

9
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600
Now the way how set works is first

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.680
you go through with the diagram.

11
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.760
So in case you have studied

12
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.360
them in, your engineering

13
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.720
or maths, that's okay.

14
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.760
If you haven't, let me give

15
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.000
you a small tour of that.

16
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.280
No worries, I'll be your

17
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.360
math teacher for a while.

18
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.440
So the word and the concept

19
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.720
of the set is mathematical.

20
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.800
And the way how it works is you have

21
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.480
some of the data just like here.

22
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.640
And we'll get this data into orange.

23
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.600
That's nice.

24
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.040
And we have another data which is

25
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.840
in another color, maybe yellow.

26
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.440
So the way how set works is when

27
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.880
you actually overlap these

28
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.440
two things, what you are getting

29
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.040
and how you are getting.

30
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.680
So we can see this whole thing is

31
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.160
divided into multiple portion.

32
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.480
But the interesting portion

33
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880
is just right here.

34
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.690
This is where the interesting portion

35
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.930
is.

36
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.770
I'll just go ahead

37
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.010
and make it transparent.

38
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.050
So what we see that if this is

39
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.890
called as set A, this one is set

40
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850
B means any amount of data.

41
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.130
So we can see this

42
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.730
here is a whole of A.

43
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.890
This thing is whole of B here.

44
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.690
But when we make an intersection,

45
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.930
this is point where we

46
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.010
actually mix, some portion

47
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.990
of A and some portion of B.

48
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.030
And yes, this is it.

49
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.830
So whatever is the common part here,

50
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.870
this is known as intersection.

51
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.390
Yeah, pretty unique

52
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.750
name, Intersection.

53
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.430
So this whole thing in between

54
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.870
is known as intersection.

55
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.910
Pretty easy.

56
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.070
When you want to combine

57
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.189
everything, that means you want

58
00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.990
to have everything with you.

59
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.870
This whole thing, this whole

60
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.270
thing is known as union.

61
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.270
That means I want to have

62
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.710
everything which is in the A,

63
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.510
everything in the B, everything.

64
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.320
I doesn't really care.

65
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.640
But the only thing that I care

66
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.320
about, if there is something common

67
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.720
in both of them, don't repeat

68
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.600
it again, don't write it again.

69
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
Set is known as for their uniqueness.

70
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.800
So set is designed in such

71
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.560
a way that, hey,

72
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080
everything should be unique.

73
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.160
So whenever you study about the set,

74
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.720
make sure one thing is there

75
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.560
in your mind, which is

76
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.000
everything is going to be unique.

77
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.640
Unique.

78
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.560
So set simply means

79
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.600
things are unique.

80
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990
And again, union means I want

81
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.230
to have everything

82
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.430
of this, this is known as union.

83
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.270
But if you want to have just

84
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.270
portion of it, this portion of it.

85
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.870
Again, if there is anything common

86
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.310
between both of them in this part

87
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.470
as well, I will not take them.

88
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.590
But if anything is present

89
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.030
in the A, but Not in the B.

90
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.750
I will not take that

91
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.590
in the intersection.

92
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.790
So that is the most common.

93
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.670
We have some of the others as well.

94
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190
Like you want to have difference.

95
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.020
That means, hey, give me the A.

96
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.140
But if anything is there

97
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140
in the B also, don't give me that.

98
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.380
I think the better would be

99
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.340
to take an example.

100
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.140
Now that you understand

101
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.300
the theory, part of it.

102
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.380
Example would be super, super easy.

103
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.340
Moving on to the chapter number nine.

104
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.740
We are into chapter nine.

105
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.100
Py now.

106
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.260
What can we do?

107
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.700
So let's just say we have,

108
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.820
essential spices.

109
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.450
And the way how we write

110
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.370
the set is like this.

111
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.330
There are other ways as

112
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.170
well, but this is the most

113
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.850
easy way to write the set.

114
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.650
So we have, cardamom,

115
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.010
and we have ginger.

116
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.930
And another set that we

117
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.730
have is maybe cinnamon.

118
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.490
All right, we have another one.

119
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.810
This time we'll not call them

120
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.290
as essential spice,

121
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.130
but rather we'll call them as

122
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.380
optional spice, optional spice.

123
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.500
And we have to change them.

124
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.300
So instead of cardamom, let's have

125
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.180
cloves, and we'll keep the ginger.

126
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.820
But we're going

127
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.900
to change the cinnamon.

128
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.380
So ginger is the common part.

129
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.900
Again, the order doesn't matter.

130
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.419
It can be at any position.

131
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.420
That really doesn't matter.

132
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.460
So we'll have the black pepper.

133
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.820
All right.

134
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.300
Yes.

135
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.620
Being from India, I

136
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620
know a lot of spices.

137
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.660
Now, let's just say I want

138
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.700
to have an all spices box.

139
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.580
And in the all spices box, I want

140
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.150
to have all of them, but there's no

141
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.190
point of having duplicate of them.

142
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.950
So for this, I can have a union.

143
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.670
And union combines unique spices.

144
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.149
So for this, all I have to do

145
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.190
is take the essential spices,

146
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.750
use this sign, which is just

147
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.990
below your backspace key.

148
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.190
This is a pipe operator,

149
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.629
also known as union.

150
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.590
And then I can go ahead

151
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.830
and have the optional spices.

152
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.150
And you get the idea the all

153
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.910
spices is just like that.

154
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.030
Should we print it out?

155
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.910
Probably yes.

156
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.200
All spices.

157
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.720
And we'll have all spices.

158
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.640
Open this up and let's

159
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000
run the chapter nine.

160
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.680
And there we go.

161
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680
We have the ginger, clove, cardamom,

162
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.840
black pepper, and cinnamon.

163
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.760
But there is no presence

164
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.160
of the ginger twice.

165
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.040
That's the whole goal.

166
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.080
That's the union.

167
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.480
You get all of them, but you

168
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.800
don't get the reputation.

169
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.280
It's a very unique property of this

170
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.240
and used actually quite a lot.

171
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.450
We can actually go ahead and find,

172
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.530
what are the common one of them.

173
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.450
So we can just go ahead

174
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.770
and write like this.

175
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.690
So I want to find the common spices.

176
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.530
What are the common

177
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.770
between both of them?

178
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.770
For This, I have to say

179
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.970
essential spice.

180
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.930
And we want to have

181
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.090
an intersection of it.

182
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.290
Remember, the intersection

183
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.090
is this portion.

184
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.490
So we want to have an intersection.

185
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.810
And this is how you write.

186
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.570
No, I wish it would be in

187
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.730
for intersection, but it

188
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.050
is actually ampersand.

189
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.380
So.

190
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.900
So we have the optional spices.

191
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.180
And the interesting part

192
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.860
is, what do we get in here?

193
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.140
So first of all, this is going

194
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.460
to be common spices.

195
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.420
And then instead of the all spices,

196
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.220
we'll have the common spices.

197
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.580
Let's run this.

198
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.860
This would be fun to see.

199
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.860
So in the common spices, we

200
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.100
can see the only ingredient

201
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.540
which is common is ginger.

202
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.820
Between both of them, if there

203
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.380
would be no common ingredient,

204
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.820
we would get nothing.

205
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.860
That's it.

206
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.060
One last thing that's remaining

207
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.900
up here is the differences.

208
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.380
So let's try to leave that.

209
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.060
Let's also learn about that.

210
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.100
We are going to call this one

211
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.020
as only in, not like that.

212
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.380
Only in essential.

213
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.660
So how do we do that?

214
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.020
I want to find the spices

215
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.700
which are only in the essential,

216
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.820
not in the optional.

217
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.739
So easy part.

218
00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.540
I can take the essential spices

219
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.780
and I can remove all the optional.

220
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.380
There we go.

221
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.900
And then we can just go

222
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.150
ahead and print it.

223
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.750
So instead of common spices, we'll

224
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.230
just go for only in essential.

225
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.790
And we will say only

226
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.230
in essential spices.

227
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.990
Pretty easy.

228
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.910
I hope this demo gives you

229
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.270
an idea about how it works.

230
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.500
Only in essentials,

231
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.390
are cinnamon and cardamom, because

232
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.630
ginger is common for both

233
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.510
of them, so it's being removed.

234
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.070
Pretty fun.

235
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.210
Pretty easy.

236
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.810
There is also a final thing

237
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.170
in the world of set, which is

238
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.410
known as again, membership test.

239
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.610
And yes, membership test

240
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.690
remains exactly same.

241
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.810
Whenever you want to check whether

242
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.890
this member exists in a particular

243
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.050
set or not, you ask questions

244
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.570
and you can simply ask them.

245
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.690
For example, I can just

246
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.890
have a simple print statement

247
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.050
and formatted string.

248
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.570
I will say is.

249
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.830
Then again clove.

250
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.990
Again, I have to be

251
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.150
case sensitive here.

252
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.510
Clove.

253
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.190
Or did I wrote it as cloves?

254
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.950
Yeah, I wrote it as cloves.

255
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:31.590
Is cloves in essential spices?

256
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.670
And then simply use the curly braces

257
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.350
and ask, what do you want to check?

258
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.990
I want to check for cloves.

259
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.070
Where do you want to check in?

260
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.710
And whatever the variable

261
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.350
that is essential spices.

262
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.790
That's it.

263
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.430
You put this up and there we go.

264
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.350
We run this and it says,

265
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.670
is clove in essential spices False

266
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.670
because it doesn't exist.

267
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.070
Probably I wrote it wrong.

268
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.150
Cloves.

269
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.270
We'll copy this.

270
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.550
Oh, it's actually not

271
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.430
in essential spices.

272
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.270
It is in optional spices.

273
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.350
So that's why I thought

274
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.830
little different so is

275
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.070
it an optional spices?

276
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.420
Let's just see.

277
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.780
Optional spices.

278
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.700
Okay let's see.

279
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.860
Yes true this is available in this.

280
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.700
Now there is one more thing known

281
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.140
available in this

282
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.380
so far you can actually do all

283
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.700
the manipulation and everything

284
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.500
in the set set by default is known

285
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.180
for uniqueness only.

286
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.540
We don't worry about too much

287
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.179
but if you want to freeze any

288
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.620
of the set there is

289
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.020
a concept known as frozen set.

290
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.500
It is available it has built

291
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.260
an immutable unordered collection

292
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.100
of unique elements.

293
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.539
It is also being used sometimes

294
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.220
but again no need

295
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.380
to worry too much about this.

296
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.660
Just remember there is a set there

297
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.300
is a frozen set both of them are

298
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.820
available the working wise they are

299
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.460
exactly same no problem there.

300
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.620
That's it and pretty

301
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.820
much it about the sets.

302
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.180
Hope you have enjoyed it and let's

303
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.700
catch up in the next video.

304
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.140
Hope you have reviewed us.
