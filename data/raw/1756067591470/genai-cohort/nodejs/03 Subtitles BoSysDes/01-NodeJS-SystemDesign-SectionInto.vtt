00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.280
All right, so hey there and welcome

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.680
to a very exciting

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920
new section on system design.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280
So in this particular section

5
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.560
we are going to master

6
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.480
the fundamentals of system design.

7
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.840
We are going to see how

8
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.080
in real world these servers work.

9
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.600
What is a server?

10
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.960
What is your scaling?

11
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.640
What are different,

12
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.040
different scaling policies?

13
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.360
What is vertical scaling?

14
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.760
What is horizontal scaling?

15
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.240
How do systems work at a scale?

16
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.600
What are queue systems?

17
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.680
What is pubnub and how these

18
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.160
systems, how these all the

19
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.240
components of system design work

20
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.500
together to become a robust

21
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.380
system, how Your Netflix and

22
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.420
YouTube works at that much scale

23
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.380
and how even this platform where

24
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.980
you are watching this video is

25
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.220
getting delivered to you.

26
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.740
This particular section is really,

27
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.220
really, really important for all

28
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.460
the beginners because this is

29
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.300
where you actually get the gist of

30
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.900
all the system design components

31
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.380
and what is happening behind the

32
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.140
scenes.

33
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.060
So I welcome you to this very

34
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.060
interesting section

35
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.940
of system design and with that,

36
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.466
let's start with the section.
