00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.040
Another day, another challenge.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.480
I love these challenge approach.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.000
It teaches us so much.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.200
So let's start with this

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.480
reading the fresh new

6
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.280
challenge in front of us.

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.880
Let's just say the challenge says

8
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.040
not just.

9
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440
Let's just say it is saying that

10
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
you want to simulate a tea heating.

11
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.920
It starts with 40 degree

12
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.880
Celsius, of course, and boils

13
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.440
at 100 degrees Celsius.

14
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.280
Your task is pretty simple.

15
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.760
Use a while loop.

16
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.280
And this is a new kind of a loop.

17
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.120
We haven't seen that

18
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.480
in the past so far.

19
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.640
Increase the temperature by 15

20
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.200
until it reaches or exceeds 100.

21
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.640
Print each temperature step.

22
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.280
All right.

23
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.600
And after that also we'll

24
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.360
print some message.

25
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.120
So let's go ahead

26
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880
and try out the loops.

27
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.960
So this is going to be

28
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.240
my, I guess sixth one.

29
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.600
So let's create a new file and call

30
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.560
this one as 06/ underscore and let's

31
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
call this one as tea temperature.

32
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.960
There we go.

33
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.920
So the step one is it asks us

34
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.480
to create a variable that is

35
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.480
temperature or you can

36
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480
just call it as temp

37
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.400
for short and starts with 40.

38
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.800
We don't have to put a sign like

39
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.880
degrees Celsius or something.

40
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.080
For us it's just 40.

41
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.280
Now we have to use while loop

42
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.680
and we have to take care that it

43
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.120
needs to run till the hundred.

44
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.240
So the for loop is also pretty good.

45
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880
But for loop is majorly used

46
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720
for iterating over a list or when we

47
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.880
know there is something which

48
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.240
has auto ending or something.

49
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.210
Here we have to check and keep

50
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.890
on checking for a certain condition.

51
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.170
So just like we have if statement,

52
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.690
we also have a while statement

53
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.450
also known as while loop.

54
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.250
This is going to keep

55
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.690
on doing the stuff until

56
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.410
the condition becomes false.

57
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.690
So for example, the condition

58
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.890
which we are checking for is

59
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.210
temperature less than 100.

60
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.970
You can also check for equals

61
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.410
to 100 as well, just like this.

62
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.650
Less than equal to 100.

63
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.450
But we'll just check

64
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.610
for less than 100.

65
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.970
The moment it becomes 100.

66
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.730
That means it's done, it's boiled.

67
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.380
Now first of all it says that I want

68
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.340
to print increase the temperature by

69
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.020
15 until it reached or exceed 100.

70
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.060
And then we want to print

71
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.860
the temperature in each step.

72
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.580
So I would prefer to print my

73
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.020
temperature first, otherwise

74
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.220
if the value is all gone, it's

75
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.860
not going to be available.

76
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.020
Or anyways you can print

77
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.980
it afterwards as well.

78
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.180
No problem there.

79
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.460
We'll just go ahead and say

80
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.860
current temperature

81
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.750
and then we'll just print

82
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870
the temperature just like that.

83
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.350
It also says that you need

84
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.710
to add the temperature by 15

85
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.630
until it decreases 100.

86
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.590
So every single time we obviously

87
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
have the access to this

88
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.390
temperature, we are going to go

89
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.670
ahead and say that whatever the

90
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.590
value of temperature is, we are

91
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.710
going to add 15 to this.

92
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.670
Now this is a very common syntax

93
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.910
and so many times you add 15 or one

94
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.480
or whatever the value to itself.

95
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.990
And it is such a common statement,

96
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.350
by the way, I just press control

97
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.270
slash to quickly comment a line.

98
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.710
This is such a common statement

99
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.670
that you will see that

100
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.230
temperature plus equals 15.

101
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.310
The line number 5 and line

102
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.830
number 6 are exactly same.

103
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.070
This also adds 15 to the existing

104
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.470
value of temperature.

105
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.950
This is a shorthand notation

106
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.870
of what we wrote about.

107
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.870
So whatever feels good

108
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.270
to you, you can use that.

109
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.470
Most of the time you'll see

110
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.750
people using the short one.

111
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.230
So plus equals means whatever

112
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.430
the existing values is, we

113
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.990
want to Increase it by 15.

114
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.360
Python is full

115
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.520
of these kinds of things.

116
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.040
Now we'll go outside of it, make

117
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.080
sure you keep an eye on the

118
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.520
indentation and we'll just print

119
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.000
up a message which says that T is

120
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.680
ready to boil, or T is ready to

121
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.040
be served.

122
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.000
So water is all ready.

123
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.360
So T, you can boil the T.

124
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.280
Now we'll save this and see

125
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.400
the result and I'll show you

126
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.480
different ways of how this

127
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.720
result can be manipulated.

128
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.120
Pretty simple, no big deal there.

129
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.780
So we'll just go ahead

130
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.820
and say Python 3.

131
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.460
This time it's 06.

132
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.140
And there we go.

133
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.020
So we can see current temperature

134
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.940
is 40, then we have 55, then

135
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.540
we have 70, then we have 85

136
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.140
and then it gets ready because it's

137
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.139
increasing by in itself 15.

138
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.700
The only change that you're going

139
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.420
to see if I take this line number

140
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.900
four and move it to the very end,

141
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.420
or probably we print the message

142
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.540
after increasing the value.

143
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.940
So a shortcut is just hold down

144
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.450
the option key or alt key

145
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.290
and move this line at the bottom.

146
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.050
Let's try to see what happens when

147
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.649
we run the program like this.

148
00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.410
So notice here, this time it says

149
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.170
current temperature is 55.

150
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.970
So it comes up here, it increases

151
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.410
the temperature, so 40, added 15,

152
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.410
it becomes 55, then 70, then 85,

153
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.850
and then finally when we are here,

154
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.290
after 85, it actually increases it

155
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.130
to 100.

156
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.090
Once it is 100, that means 100

157
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.440
is not equals to 100, it is

158
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.160
it not less than 100, it is

159
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.960
actually equal to the 100.

160
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.200
So we simply get out of it

161
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.680
and we simply print this.

162
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.760
So again, depends on what

163
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.720
you really want to do.

164
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.000
I like to keep this at the very top

165
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.200
just like this.

166
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.320
Make sure you understand that

167
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.480
the how you write the code,

168
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.560
it's actually going to execute

169
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.960
in the same order as well.

170
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.440
So that is it.

171
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.960
Now you understand the while loop

172
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.520
as well as the importance of it,

173
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.840
as well as a use case for it.

174
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.920
You have done a practical

175
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.200
example for it.

176
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.400
That is it for this video.

177
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.080
Let's catch up in the next one.
