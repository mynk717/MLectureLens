00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.920
And in this video I'm going to show

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.480
you on a Mac that how you can

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.120
install the Python as well as how

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.160
you can run the Python programs.

6
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.720
Now there are two basic ways of how

7
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.240
you can run the Python programs.

8
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
One is in the shell itself.

9
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.920
That means in the terminal.

10
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.919
Yeah, the black thing

11
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.520
on the screen, terminal, shell,

12
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
whatever you call that, you can

13
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.720
simply go ahead and install that,

14
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.920
use an existing one and you can

15
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.640
just run Python in that.

16
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.000
The only problem is once

17
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.280
it's gone, it's just gone.

18
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.760
There is no memory or there is no

19
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.200
stored way of keeping the files.

20
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.520
Other way of writing the Python

21
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.720
programs are into a file with a

22
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
special extension PY so that you

23
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.760
can just store the code that you

24
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.960
have written into a file and you

25
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.720
can reuse it.

26
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.240
And yes, obviously the second one is

27
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.880
much more easier way, but I'll show

28
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.240
you that how it's being done and how

29
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.960
you can actually install the Python.

30
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360
Now installing the Python is one

31
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.680
of the most easiest thing, one

32
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.120
of the most simplified thing.

33
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.680
I have installed a lot of programming

34
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.040
language, nothing comes

35
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.600
nearby when installing the Python.

36
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
It's the most easiest one.

37
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.240
Simply go to python.org and just

38
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.400
click on the downloads and you

39
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900
can just download it for or this

40
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.580
one, it automatically detects

41
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.300
your system whether it's a Mac or

42
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.340
Linux or Windows and it just

43
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.700
gives you the exact version which

44
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.500
you want.

45
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.180
Now also in here you can see

46
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.100
there are a lot of ways

47
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.180
you can actually use this.

48
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.980
This is the shell.

49
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.060
I will walk you through how you can

50
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.620
use this in your system as well.

51
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.140
But actually you can just click

52
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.540
on this and it loads up a shell

53
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.740
where you can write some basic

54
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.820
Python within just this one.

55
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.300
So it's not really the best

56
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.980
and the fun way, but I'll still show

57
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.590
you some of the way I that I can

58
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.390
just go ahead and run it like this.

59
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.910
So I can just go ahead and say two

60
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.870
plus two and yeah, it does the job,

61
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.710
it adds, it's not a calculator,

62
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.670
it does more thing.

63
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.750
For example, I can just go

64
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.070
ahead and say import sys

65
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.030
before recording the video.

66
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.550
I was trying this as well

67
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.590
and it's import sys which

68
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.070
is a library in Python.

69
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.390
Remember I told you that

70
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.030
Python has a lot of rich

71
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.430
extensive set of library.

72
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.950
This is one of that which is

73
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.930
there in Python by default.

74
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.890
But I can install so many other third

75
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.570
party libraries which other great

76
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.410
programmers have written and can

77
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.210
work with this and then I can just

78
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.770
ask it that, hey, I want to show you

79
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.330
that what kind of system version is

80
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.130
there and print it in the

81
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.170
parenthesis and it just gives me

82
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.370
that hey, the current version of

83
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.250
Python you're working on is 3.10.5

84
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.650
and whole lot of details.

85
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.570
We can understand that

86
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.930
details later on.

87
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.170
But right now if I click on the

88
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.610
download and just click on this

89
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.650
download button, it takes me on the

90
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.570
page where I can see the whole

91
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.170
different versions of Python which

92
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.650
are available.

93
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.450
So different versions

94
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.450
which you can install.

95
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.730
My recommendation is go ahead

96
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.770
and install the latest one.

97
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.250
Although the code that we're going to

98
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.010
run here is not going to be too much

99
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.850
dependent on version, any latest

100
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.450
version is going to be just fine.

101
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.170
And you can just go ahead and look

102
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.250
for other versions like

103
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.850
Windows and Linux and all that.

104
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.970
You can just click on that and it

105
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.930
will show you all the other

106
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.330
Windows installers as well.

107
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.390
Pretty easy.

108
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.830
Now let me take you onto this.

109
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.150
So once you click on the download

110
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.270
on the Mac, it will give

111
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.150
you a package just like this.

112
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.950
Just double click

113
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.750
on this and there we go.

114
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
It opens this up.

115
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.510
I'll remove this so that

116
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.110
it's not really that bothered

117
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.990
onto your screen.

118
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.430
And please excuse my other

119
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.710
code part, I keep on working

120
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.870
on the stuff so it's okay.

121
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.600
And let me click on the continue.

122
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.710
This is the first step, then

123
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.670
click on Continue again,

124
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.390
then accept the licenses.

125
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.230
Yes, I do agree.

126
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.470
I have read them thoroughly

127
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.020
of course.

128
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.660
And then look for the installation.

129
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.780
This is going to take this much

130
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.180
of installation and the type

131
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.740
and just click on install and it is

132
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.060
going to install it for you.

133
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.260
Now for me it is already

134
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.460
being installed, so no need

135
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.900
to do this again for me.

136
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.860
But if you do it again it's not going

137
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.900
to bother you anything or like that.

138
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.700
So I can just click

139
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
on this and close it.

140
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.540
Now next is you need a terminal

141
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.540
to verify that and I can just press

142
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.700
command space and click on Terminal

143
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.620
and you can just open up your

144
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.540
default terminal which is available.

145
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.650
So no, remind me later.

146
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.370
This is not here, so please

147
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.130
excuse me, I'll just quit this.

148
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.250
This is not the terminal

149
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.610
that I'm looking for.

150
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.170
I'm looking for this Terminal app

151
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.570
and please excuse me,

152
00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.890
this is my other system.

153
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.210
I'll just open up the Terminal app

154
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.090
and this is the second one

155
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.730
which I was looking up for.

156
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.250
This is on the Mac so I can

157
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.210
just go ahead and use it.

158
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.290
I'll tell you another

159
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.570
better version of it, but here I can

160
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.970
just go ahead and say Python.

161
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.410
In the Mac you have to say Python 3

162
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.410
with the correct spelling

163
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.290
of course, Python 3, because

164
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.250
on the Mac Python comes as A

165
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.650
default which is Python 2.

166
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.850
I don't know why they are still

167
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.050
shipping it Python 2, but Python 3

168
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.330
is something that you have to write.

169
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.090
Then simply say dash dash, that

170
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.770
is two minus and then simply

171
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.690
go ahead and say version and this

172
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.730
gives you that, hey, I have

173
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.850
installed Python 3.13.2.

174
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.770
As long as it is giving you some

175
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.610
version back, that's okay.

176
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.930
That is all good.

177
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.410
Now I these days don't use

178
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.770
this terminal too much because

179
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.450
I have a better thing installed

180
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.610
on my system and I will

181
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.970
still walk you through.

182
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.210
Now again, I love it.

183
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.210
That's why I'm showing you.

184
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.730
Feel free to not use it.

185
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.130
I use Warp and this is a terminal

186
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.810
which is available these days also

187
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.330
on Windows as well.

188
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.450
I happen to use this.

189
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.810
So if you look at this,

190
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.210
I do have available up here.

191
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.730
So this is my Warp.

192
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.290
I use it and again I can just run

193
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.490
the same command here as well.

194
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.050
I can just go ahead and say Python

195
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.660
and, and it gives me suggestions,

196
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.300
AI assistant and whatnot.

197
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.420
I can just hit enter.

198
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.100
So this is the one way

199
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.180
of running the Python.

200
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.420
If you want to run up, fire

201
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.860
up the same shell that we saw

202
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.780
on the website, we can

203
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.900
actually go ahead and do this.

204
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.300
All I have to do is say python3 and

205
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.980
hit enter and it loads up the same

206
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.060
shell that I saw there and I can do

207
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.900
all the things that I saw there,

208
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.220
two plus two, which is very

209
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.820
interesting.

210
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.340
And it gives me four.

211
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.380
That is nice.

212
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.820
I can go ahead and import the

213
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.730
sys and now I can just go ahead

214
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.570
and say print and then I can

215
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.610
say sys version and it gives me

216
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.890
the system version or what

217
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.690
Python I'm installed I have on

218
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.570
my system.

219
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.650
I can go ahead and type

220
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.770
the exit and it exits it out.

221
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.410
Previously it was not the case.

222
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.689
Previously it was all the time

223
00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.170
exit with the parenthesis

224
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.490
and then only it exit.

225
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.770
But in the latest version of

226
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.170
Python they actually made a change

227
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.890
and wrote even a blog post that

228
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.450
now exit works because a lot

229
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.870
of people just write exit.

230
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.790
It was a common thing.

231
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.110
And throughout this course you're

232
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.630
going to hear these kinds of stories

233
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.470
which I think you will enjoy.

234
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.710
Now, apart from this, let me

235
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.910
also go ahead and show you

236
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.190
another way of running

237
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.950
and running the Python files.

238
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.830
So I'll just close this terminal

239
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.870
because I don't need it.

240
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.110
So I have this VS code as my code

241
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.030
editor, in case you're wondering.

242
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.990
Yes, you can go ahead

243
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.230
and download this as well.

244
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.790
So let's just Google this quickly.

245
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.950
This is VS code.

246
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.990
This is, these days one

247
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.070
of the Most popular editor available

248
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.680
for Mac, Windows and Linux.

249
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.320
And it does have AI as well.

250
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.840
We will be using it very less

251
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.760
in the initial time and after that

252
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.560
I'll walk you through how you

253
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.800
can use that a lot, better way.

254
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.760
And you can just go ahead

255
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.120
and download it for Mac,

256
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.880
Windows, whichever you want.

257
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.440
And this is what gives

258
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.040
you installation.

259
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.879
It's pretty easy and straightforward.

260
00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.480
Now you'll see it like this.

261
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.200
And why is it looking the way it is?

262
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.520
Because I have installed

263
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.600
a theme on it.

264
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.200
So if you google it, just

265
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.880
for Chai theme, VS code.

266
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.960
This is the one theme which I

267
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.480
design and I'm super proud of it.

268
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.840
And it's almost 91,000 installs.

269
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.440
It looks good.

270
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.480
The code looks really

271
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.440
beautiful in it.

272
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.920
Use the dark mode only

273
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.520
and it looks out of the box.

274
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.360
So all you can do is click

275
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.000
on the extensions here.

276
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.040
This is the icon for the extension.

277
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.479
Just click up here and look

278
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.680
for the Chai theme.

279
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.040
So Chai theme and this is the one.

280
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.400
Just click on the install

281
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.160
and that's it.

282
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.760
It works.

283
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.600
And look, code looks beautiful.

284
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.240
Now apart from this, what you can do

285
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.040
is just drag and drop this folder.

286
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.880
So I have this folder Python ds.

287
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.240
Just drag and drop a folder

288
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.820
and that's it.

289
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.500
And we are going to write, we

290
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.060
are going to learn how to write all

291
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.860
of our Python code up here.

292
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.940
Now forget about all

293
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.940
these installation that

294
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.820
is happening up here.

295
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.100
These are all my AI

296
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.500
editors and assistants

297
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.820
and extension that I have.

298
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.459
I do work a lot in Python and when

299
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:51.580
the very first time you actually

300
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.500
write some Python code or save some

301
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.660
file, it might ask you to install

302
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.620
some additional extensions to help

303
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.820
you, to give you better suggestions

304
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.420
for the code.

305
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.900
And don't hesitate, just go

306
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.100
ahead and install them.

307
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.040
Now for the first time we are going

308
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.360
to remove this, but I'm going

309
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.120
to go ahead and create a folder

310
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.160
and inside this folder we're going

311
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.040
to create some Python code file.

312
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.680
So we're going to say 01 basics.

313
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.760
This is where the folder is.

314
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.960
Inside this folder I'm going

315
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.040
to create a new file.

316
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.440
I'm going to call this one as

317
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.960
test Python py.

318
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.400
The PY extension is really

319
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.010
important because this makes

320
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.490
the compiler know that this is

321
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.930
a file that is supposed to be

322
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.850
run by the Python interpreter

323
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.370
or the Python programming

324
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.450
language software.

325
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.929
Just go ahead and write the exact

326
00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.570
same code that we have seen here.

327
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.370
So import sys we're going

328
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.650
to do that and I'm going to zoom

329
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.250
this up a little bit so it's

330
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.810
much Easier for you to see.

331
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.330
And there we go.

332
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.090
Once we have this import sys, we're

333
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.210
going to go ahead and say print.

334
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.650
Notice here the suggestions comes

335
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.850
up automatically for me.

336
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.090
This is because it has

337
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.880
already installed the Python sys

338
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.000
intellisense for me.

339
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.320
Go ahead and install that for you.

340
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.440
But again, no big deal, we can

341
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.000
just go ahead and write this and

342
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.480
I can just go ahead and see much

343
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.520
more suggestions compared to what

344
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.760
I was able to see on the

345
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.240
interpreter.

346
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.040
That's why we use these editors.

347
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.080
Once I go ahead and use this, then I

348
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.400
can actually open up the terminal.

349
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.480
I can just go ahead and click on

350
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.040
the terminal and say new terminal.

351
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.360
Or I can use the shortcut,

352
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.880
for me it's control and the tilde

353
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.160
just below your escape key.

354
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.530
And this opens up a terminal.

355
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.090
And in this terminal I can just

356
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.970
go ahead and say Python of course,

357
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.570
three because I'm on a Mac.

358
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.730
Then go into the folder 01.

359
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.170
When you open up your terminal,

360
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.370
it automatically opens

361
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.850
up this folder for you and then

362
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.170
you can just walk through.

363
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.250
So I'll just go into this, I press

364
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.130
the tab, by the way, and then I can

365
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.450
again, write this test Python py.

366
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.730
Once I hit enter, this

367
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.010
actually runs my code.

368
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.170
Now the only difference is this

369
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.410
code is permanently with me.

370
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.810
So this is so much easier to work

371
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.640
on with and we'll be using this.

372
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.880
But I'll walk you through a little

373
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.320
bit minor details before

374
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.760
writing the files like this.

375
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.840
But yeah, this is a fully

376
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.720
functional Python code.

377
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.040
And congratulations, before

378
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.320
even writing hello world,

379
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.360
you have written a much bigger

380
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.320
and much better of a code.

381
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.239
So this is what we have as

382
00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:05.640
of now and I'm pretty sure

383
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.040
that you have enjoyed this.

384
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.160
It was not that bad.

385
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.400
It was easier comparatively.

386
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400
We just downloaded a Python version,

387
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.790
we wrote some code in the shell,

388
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.350
we wrote some code, we learned

389
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.230
about the VS code as well as

390
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.670
Warp, a really good terminal.

391
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.910
And I'll show you a lot

392
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.710
of details as we go further.

393
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.190
This is the very basics, very

394
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.310
first of the Python code.

395
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.070
And you might have already

396
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.630
realized, yes, we are

397
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.110
not going into the basics.

398
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.310
We will be going into

399
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.350
extensive, in depth.

400
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.950
And yes, I've been

401
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.870
writing code for years.

402
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.430
I want to transfer this, all

403
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.150
of this knowledge to you as well.

404
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.310
That is it for this video.

405
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.590
Let's catch up into the next video.
