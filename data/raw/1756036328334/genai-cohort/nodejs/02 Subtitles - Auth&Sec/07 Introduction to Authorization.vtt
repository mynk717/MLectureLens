00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.480
Okay, so welcome to one

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.960
another exciting video

3
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.880
in the authentication section.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720
And in this particular video

5
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.840
we are going to cover the concept

6
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.000
of authorization.

7
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.800
So now at this particular point we

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.880
already know what is authentication.

9
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.320
Authentication means

10
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.960
that the server knows who are you.

11
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.120
That means you are authenticated.

12
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.240
And there are two ways

13
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.960
of authentication.

14
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.920
Number one, there's a session

15
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.760
based authentication where you

16
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.670
give a session ID or a temporary

17
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.150
ID to a user, where the data

18
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.350
about that ID is stored on the

19
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.870
server, maybe in a database,

20
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.950
maybe in your memory.

21
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.430
And that is where you let

22
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.830
the user authenticate it.

23
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.510
And on the other hand you had

24
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.910
a stateless version of

25
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.470
the authentication that was JSON web

26
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.710
tokens where you actually store

27
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.430
the information about the user

28
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.350
inside the token itself.

29
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.830
So that was authentication

30
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.750
that whether you are

31
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.270
authenticated or not.

32
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.950
Does server recognize you?

33
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.230
Do server know who are you?

34
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.270
That is authentication.

35
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.810
Now let's jump onto the concept

36
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.170
of authorization.

37
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.129
Authorization is basically the next

38
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.010
step of the authentication.

39
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.330
In order to be authorized

40
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.570
to do something, you have to be

41
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.330
first of all authenticated.

42
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.010
There is no authorization

43
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.410
possible without authentication.

44
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.610
So first step is something

45
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.730
that we have already done.

46
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.010
Authorization means if

47
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.130
you have access

48
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.530
to a particular resource or not.

49
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.130
So let's imagine that this is

50
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.250
a user, that is U1, okay?

51
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.610
And this is a user,

52
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.380
let's say U2, okay?

53
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.140
Now in on your server, okay,

54
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.420
on your server, let's say

55
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.100
you have multiple routes, right?

56
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.060
You have a lot of data

57
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.020
on the back end.

58
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.260
Now let's say you want makes

59
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.540
a request to get some piece of data.

60
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.060
Okay?

61
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.380
So let's say that this is basically

62
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.260
a data about all the payments.

63
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.540
So let's say you were building some

64
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.500
financial application and this is

65
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.060
the data about all the payments.

66
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.420
Okay?

67
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.300
So all the payment data lives here.

68
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.940
Now technically, if you imagine

69
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.300
this thing, payments data

70
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.700
is a critical data, right?

71
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.780
You don't want to share this

72
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.220
particular thing publicly or

73
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.520
something, something like that.

74
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280
So now you have to build

75
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.160
a mechanism that if you want,

76
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.840
hey user one, are you really

77
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.320
allowed to access this data?

78
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.960
If so, you have to return

79
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.120
this data to the user.

80
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.160
But if not, see if he does not have

81
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.000
that particular access, you can just

82
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.640
return return an unauthorized error.

83
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.240
So number one thing is that

84
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.680
number one, see this U1 user has

85
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.720
to be authenticated.

86
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.200
That means server

87
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.400
knows who the U1 is.

88
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.610
Then the next step comes

89
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.440
that do you have the permission

90
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.680
to access this particular resource?

91
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.600
If so, you can return this data.

92
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.880
If not, just return

93
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400
an error response.

94
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.880
So how can you achieve

95
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.760
this particular thing?

96
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.759
It's very simple.

97
00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.440
I mean there are a lot of techniques

98
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.640
to implement authorization,

99
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.560
but let's cover

100
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.280
the simplest one, that is

101
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160
just attach a, role to this user.

102
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.880
So let's say if U1

103
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.530
has a role, which is admin, right?

104
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.330
Very simple.

105
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210
And you too has a role that

106
00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.850
is, let's say, simple user.

107
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.690
Now if the role is admin,

108
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.370
you return this particular data,

109
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.650
but if the role is not admin, you

110
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.450
are not going to return this data.

111
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.810
And what is this role?

112
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.090
At the end of the day, this

113
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.530
role is nothing but just

114
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.450
a value in the database.

115
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.090
So in the users table, I

116
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.530
can extend that table

117
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.410
to have one more entry, I.e.

118
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.290
role, where default value can

119
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.250
be user, and we can promote

120
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.610
special users to be admin.

121
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.660
And then we can even store

122
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.540
this particular thing

123
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.340
in the user's token, right?

124
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.700
You have JWT tokens,

125
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.700
which are signed tokens.

126
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.780
No one can change it.

127
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.420
So in the JWT token I can just write

128
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.060
role admin, and then I can check

129
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.980
that if you are an admin,

130
00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.780
only and only then you are allowed

131
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.300
to access this particular resource.

132
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.620
So basically this is how

133
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.820
the authorization happens.

134
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.460
So this is the basic concept

135
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.380
behind the authorization.

136
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.420
So what I would like you to do is

137
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.420
pause the video right here.

138
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.060
Implement.

139
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.580
Try to implement this particular

140
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.260
thing on your own before

141
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.940
jumping onto the next video.

142
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.740
Because in the next video I will

143
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.020
be coding this particular thing.

144
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.340
I'll be refactoring the whole

145
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.020
code, but I would like you

146
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.540
to give it a try first.

147
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.740
So let's meet you

148
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.860
in the next particular video.
