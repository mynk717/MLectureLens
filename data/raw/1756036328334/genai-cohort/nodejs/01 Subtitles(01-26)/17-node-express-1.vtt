00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.600
Okay, so right now you can

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.560
see that we have a very simple

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.920
application that we built

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.520
in the last video and which

5
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.640
is working absolutely fine.

6
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.280
But guys, tell me one thing,

7
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.600
just tell me one thing.

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.440
Do you think that this code

9
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.400
right here, which is a very

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.239
small code, is easy to write?

11
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:16.920
Do you think?

12
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.160
Do you like this code?

13
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
Absolutely not, right?

14
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.880
This particular

15
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.960
code is absolute mess.

16
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.080
Now imagine that you are working in

17
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960
a company where you have a very,

18
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.800
very, very big code and you have

19
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.960
database integration, you have

20
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.240
redis integration, you have rate

21
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880
limiting, you have a lot of

22
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.160
features set up and, coding like

23
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.880
this and that to having five to six

24
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.600
developers in your team.

25
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.760
Just imagine the amount of mess that

26
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.360
you guys are going to create, right?

27
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880
Because you cannot have switch

28
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.360
cases, switch cases, switch cases

29
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920
and do all the things manually.

30
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.240
This is not at all a good

31
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.000
developer experience, right?

32
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.680
You need some framework.

33
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.640
You need something

34
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.640
that, you know, makes a,

35
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.240
consistency among developer.

36
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.590
You need something that takes away

37
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.110
this whole messy part and creates

38
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.630
your code in a more structured

39
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.390
and a more maintainable way.

40
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.790
So for that there is one

41
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.990
very popular framework that

42
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.430
is known as Express js.

43
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.830
You might have heard about it.

44
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.750
And right now Express

45
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.310
5 is also out there.

46
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.030
So this Express, which is like

47
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.510
a battle tested and it is

48
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.630
therefore in the market

49
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.070
for years and years and it will stay

50
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.510
in the market for years.

51
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.830
So this basically takes

52
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.230
this headache, okay?

53
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.900
So from the next video onwards, we

54
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.800
are not going to use this HTTP

55
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.600
module because, you know, using this

56
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200
HTTP raw module gives you a good

57
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.680
capability to create a server.

58
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.480
But the code is absolute mess.

59
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.160
So we are going to use Express

60
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.800
which internally, which

61
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.480
internally uses this HTTP

62
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.280
package only to create servers.

63
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.440
So we are going to use this.

64
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.560
So let me just show you a hello

65
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.920
world example at what it looks.

66
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520
So see how clean it is.

67
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.640
You just do Express.

68
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.440
You create an application of Express.

69
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.760
You say, hey, if there is a get

70
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.430
request and slash, send this

71
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.430
response listen on this port.

72
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.830
So this is how, this is how

73
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.110
declarative this Express jss, okay?

74
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.070
And not only that, when you

75
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.870
are coding a server, a lot

76
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.150
of things comes in, right?

77
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.110
You need header parsing, you know,

78
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.229
you need body parsing, you know

79
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.389
how to say, you should know how

80
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.390
to send responses, how can you

81
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.910
declutter your code, how can you

82
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.310
move your codes into separate

83
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.710
files?

84
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.750
So there are a lot of things

85
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.710
that are going to come.

86
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.710
So for that we are going

87
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.270
to use Express js.

88
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.030
And trust me, all the companies,

89
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790
big companies, small companies,

90
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.790
everyone uses Express js a lot.

91
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.790
And even in future,

92
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.190
any other library comes they are

93
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.790
inspired from the Express.

94
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.270
So if you know Express, you

95
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.750
can easily adapt to other

96
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.830
frameworks and libraries as well.

97
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.990
So I'll meet you in the next

98
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.110
class where we are going to set

99
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.510
up an Express application.

100
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.350
Till then, bye bye and take care.
