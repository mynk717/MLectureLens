00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
Well, well, well, you guys are doing

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.560
absolutely great in no time.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.200
You have learned a lot

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.920
of things in Node js, right?

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.000
So in this particular video, let's

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.840
hop and create a server for us.

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.160
But guys, before creating a server,

8
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.280
let's understand

9
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.920
what the server thing is, right?

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.240
That is more important.

11
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.120
So what we are going to do

12
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.000
is we are going to create

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.320
an HTTP server, okay?

14
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.720
And but before that, let's

15
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.160
understand that what is this HTTP?

16
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.880
What is the server?

17
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.000
What is a request, what

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is response, all that.

19
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
So HTTP stands for hyper Text

20
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.840
transfer protocol.

21
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240
So that means it's basically

22
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.880
a protocol for transferring

23
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.800
the information on the Internet.

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.120
Okay, how it works?

25
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.080
So you, so whenever you talk

26
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.720
about APIs, whenever you talk

27
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.510
about Internet or servers,

28
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.950
there are two components.

29
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.030
One is you.

30
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.110
You are who, you are a client, right?

31
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.390
You are a client.

32
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.030
So let's say that this is a client.

33
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.550
Client can be a machine, it

34
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.910
can be a mobile phone,

35
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.270
a laptop, a MacBook, anything.

36
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.550
On the other hand, you have

37
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.470
what, you have a server.

38
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.270
Okay?

39
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.390
Now what is a server?

40
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.830
Now don't think you know that this

41
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.230
server is something very fancy

42
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.230
thing or something like that.

43
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.310
No, it's just a machine

44
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.330
that is connected to the Internet

45
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.250
number one, it has a public IP

46
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.690
address and it has a public

47
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.210
facing IP address, right?

48
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.370
So it can be on Amazon Web Services,

49
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.850
it can be Azure, it

50
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.490
can be Google Server,

51
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.610
or even it can be a bare metal.

52
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.930
Bare metal basically means that

53
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.530
it's a server which is on

54
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.450
at your home, at your office.

55
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.410
Okay?

56
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.770
So the only thing is that

57
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.530
because this is a server number

58
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.850
one, it's a 24, 7 on machine.

59
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.930
So it's, it's 24 by 7,

60
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.020
you know, uptime.

61
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.970
But plus it has a public facing IP.

62
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.446
Public facing static IP,

63
00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:53.210
public facing static IP.

64
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.050
So let's say that this particular

65
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.130
server has an IP address of maybe

66
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.770
something like 10, you know, 24.1.2.

67
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.010
So just random address

68
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.090
I have written.

69
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.690
So this is a server.

70
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.330
Now what this client can do,

71
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.729
client basically sends

72
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.890
a request to a server, right?

73
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.780
So client always sends a request

74
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.540
request that hey, I want to do

75
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540
this, I want to do that, I want to

76
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.620
do this stuff, I want that, I want

77
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.220
to create this resource, I want to

78
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.460
create a tweet, I want to upload a

79
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.740
video.

80
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.020
It's a request.

81
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.660
Your server is responsible

82
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.300
for processing this request.

83
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.820
Now this request can be

84
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.860
anything for example.

85
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.340
So it can be a request to get

86
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.580
some data, it can be request

87
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.820
to post some data, it can be

88
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.650
a request to delete some data.

89
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.530
Any kind of request.

90
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.130
Now, at this point, as a part of

91
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.970
processing this request, it

92
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.410
says, like, first of all, you

93
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.650
have to authenticate that if

94
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.810
this particular user is allowed

95
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.210
to, like, you know, access that

96
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.370
particular resource, you do

97
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.410
authorization.

98
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530
That if, right, if there is

99
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.290
an authority, then you do

100
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.090
validation check and all that.

101
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.270
And then you finally process.

102
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.630
So whatever is needed.

103
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.750
Now this processing part that

104
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.030
I have written at the end, okay,

105
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.230
this processing part

106
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.910
can be a database operation.

107
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.030
So your server actually can be

108
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.350
connected to a database, right?

109
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.670
So database can be.

110
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.430
Your Postgres database can be

111
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.470
there, your MongoDB is there.

112
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.990
So you have a lot of databases.

113
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.190
It can be a simple

114
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.710
MySQL database, right?

115
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.720
It can be a MySQL database.

116
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.920
So any kind of database

117
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.120
is actually here.

118
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.640
So these are few databases

119
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.240
that we can cover.

120
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.840
Okay, so very simple, no,

121
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.080
hard and fast thing there.

122
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.120
So this particular server is like

123
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.600
connected to this database.

124
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.400
So it is doing some read and write

125
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.040
operations in the database.

126
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.840
And once the server has done

127
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.640
its work, it is going to return

128
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.720
something known as response.

129
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.950
So that means at the end it's just a,

130
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.590
request and a response.

131
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.390
Client sends a request, server

132
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.830
accepts the request,

133
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.590
do a lot of magical things in it,

134
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.670
and sends back a response.

135
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.950
And this is what is known as a,

136
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.829
request response cycle.

137
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.990
Okay, so this is a cycle, and this

138
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.550
cycle makes the client server

139
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.350
communication possible, right?
