1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.840
All right, so one more example.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.160
And again, this is a way

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.120
of writing code.

4
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.320
This is not a new topic.

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.160
This is how some people do it.

6
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.360
And the reason of the whole series is

7
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.560
to make sure that you don't just

8
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.200
mindlessly write just the loops

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480
and functions and conditionals.

10
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160
You understand what it takes

11
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.400
to write the industry level

12
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.120
code, production ready code.

13
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.400
So one of the common practice

14
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.200
that you're going to see

15
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.720
is people use dictionaries

16
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.000
instead of repeated cases.

17
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
We saw that we can actually,

18
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.290
This whole problem that I'm going

19
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.330
to show you can be done via

20
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.000
the if statements as well.

21
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.170
Can be done by the match

22
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.170
cases as well.

23
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.250
Whatever you want to use,

24
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.570
you can actually use it.

25
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.410
But I will show you a very

26
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.490
interesting example for this

27
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.170
which uses dictionary.

28
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.610
So again this can only be

29
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.570
shown in the code part.

30
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.330
There is no point

31
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.610
of discussing the theory of it.

32
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970
So I'll just go ahead and say

33
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.410
10 and this will be dictionary,

34
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.960
case, just a file name.

35
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.640
Don't bother too much about it.

36
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.000
All right, so let's just say

37
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.640
we have a users and this is

38
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.600
just a list, ordinary list.

39
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.519
Inside the list we have a sum

40
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.960
of the key value pairs.

41
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.840
So this is how we define

42
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.760
the dictionary, the key value pair.

43
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.600
Each one of them gets an id.

44
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
So let's just say this is ID

45
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.000
one and then we get another key

46
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200
which is total pretty simple.

47
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
No problem there.

48
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.320
Hope there is no issue with this.

49
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
And we get the total of 100.

50
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.480
And then finally this guy gets

51
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.360
a coupon code and everybody

52
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.680
gets a different coupon code.

53
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.120
Let's just say the coupon code that

54
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.000
he is using is going to be P20.

55
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.360
It could be any coupon code.

56
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.320
No problem there.

57
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.000
And again, this needs to be a string.

58
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.920
So I'll just go ahead

59
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.640
and change this into a string.

60
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.480
I hope there is no issue with this

61
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.560
really simple example.

62
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.360
And we need just three copies of it.

63
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
So we'll just go ahead

64
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.200
and change this one.

65
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.900
So this one will be two,

66
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.020
this one will be three.

67
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.460
Let's change the values as well.

68
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.820
This gets 150 and 80.

69
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.420
Whatever you wish to have.

70
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.540
This one is F10.

71
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.420
The first one is P20.

72
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.180
Let's keep all of our

73
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.780
coupon codes in uppercase.

74
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.380
Makes sense.

75
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.580
Most of the coupon codes are

76
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.540
usually in the uppercase.

77
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.139
It's easier and we just

78
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.620
go ahead and say P50.

79
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.980
All right, now we don't

80
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.220
have a mapping of how

81
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.420
the coupon code works.

82
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.140
So I have no idea what P20 means.

83
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.800
I don't have an idea of F10

84
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.320
means all of this.

85
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.200
So for this I'll go ahead and I

86
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.920
can definitely use if else case.

87
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680
I can go ahead and use match cases

88
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.720
for this one but I'll instead

89
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.680
use discounts as a dictionary.

90
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.280
So this is a dictionary and for

91
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.720
this dictionary I'll mention that

92
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.080
hey, we have created a Coupon

93
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.160
which says P20 and some

94
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.960
of the coupon have a discount value.

95
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.480
Some of them have a flat value.

96
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.200
Like you have seen flat 100

97
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.450
rupees off or flat 50 rupees off

98
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.530
while some of them gets

99
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.210
a discounted like 10% off, 20% off.

100
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.130
So let's just say for this one we get

101
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.210
0 uh.2 and this is

102
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.170
a percentage off and we don't give

103
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.850
any of the flat discount.

104
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.570
Maybe we can give both as well.

105
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.090
Right now that's not the goal.

106
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.600
Another coupon code

107
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.090
that we have is F10.

108
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.110
This one gives again

109
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.450
let's just say 50% off and we have

110
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.860
another one which is P50.

111
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860
This one gets a flat off.

112
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.700
So you get a 0 here 0.0 or 0

113
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.940
does means the same and this

114
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.860
gives a flat 10 rupees discount.

115
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.220
Now you have to process this

116
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.540
whole users and give them discount

117
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.900
based on the discount.

118
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.340
Now surely you can do a case that hey

119
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.940
if the case matches with P20 I'll

120
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.300
give you the discount like this.

121
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.820
But this is a very

122
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.780
real world scenario.

123
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.140
This is a very real world situation.

124
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.340
This is how a lot of coupon

125
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.060
codes are designed.

126
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.020
This is how you get the value

127
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.780
from the database, all the values

128
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.210
and, and you have to process this

129
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.650
how you're going to do that.

130
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.970
Surely 100% this can be done.

131
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.610
But there is an interesting way

132
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.530
of handling this and this is just

133
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.730
a piece of pure code, no extra

134
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.250
operator or anything like that.

135
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.810
So I can just go ahead and say for

136
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.250
user in users, that's the part once.

137
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.850
All right, we are looping

138
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.850
through all the users.

139
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.410
I hope there is no problem in it.

140
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.930
Now once I'm looping into this

141
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.730
now next thing that I want

142
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.810
to do is find out what are

143
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.050
the discount values into it.

144
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.890
So what I'll do is I'll take

145
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.650
so notice here.

146
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.450
This is a tuple.

147
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.090
This first part will give me

148
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.330
percent, the second part will

149
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.250
give me flat or fixed, whatever

150
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.490
you want to call this.

151
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.570
I will call this one as percent

152
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.050
and this one as fixed.

153
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.170
How you're going to extract

154
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.450
the values, pretty simple.

155
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.930
I'll just say discount and in that

156
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.610
you can use a lot of methods.

157
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.410
I'll just say get, which allows me

158
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.970
to get a specific key.

159
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.610
And the key that I'm going to

160
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.050
provide is going to be the coupon.

161
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.680
All right, let's use

162
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.480
all lowercase coupon.

163
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200
So discounts gets a coupon.

164
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
And we don't want to get just

165
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.680
like this, like coupon.

166
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.600
This will give me nothing.

167
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.840
So I want to go inside this.

168
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.920
So notice here I have

169
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.640
the access of this user.

170
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.040
This user means this

171
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.240
whole access property.

172
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.800
And what I want

173
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.520
to access is this coupon.

174
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.200
So again, let me just remove this.

175
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.080
So inside this get again

176
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.700
by the way, wrong asset.

177
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.180
Let me try it one more time.

178
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.180
I have this get, which is a method.

179
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.340
All right, hope that's clear now.

180
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820
And now I want to access this user.

181
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.340
Each user looks like this.

182
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.300
So I'll just say hey user, what

183
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.380
property you want to access?

184
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.700
Because it's a key value pair.

185
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.420
Now I'll use square brackets

186
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.540
and I will say coupon.

187
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.980
Make sure you don't do any typo.

188
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.740
This is the property

189
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.980
we are looking for.

190
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.620
So now we have access to this coupon.

191
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.980
And once you have this

192
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.980
I can just go come up here.

193
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.500
So just after the discount you

194
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.380
have grabbed, the get value.

195
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.460
Now in here through this

196
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.900
notice here, we are still

197
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.740
getting this one discounts.

198
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.900
So ultimately the return

199
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.980
value you are going to get.

200
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.940
This is bit interesting is going

201
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.500
to be just like this

202
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.340
and we are going to put 0, comma 0.

203
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.060
So this is the default value.

204
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.620
So if nothing we are able to grab,

205
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.380
this is something that we'll get

206
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.580
in the percent and discount.

207
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.700
So there is no discount,

208
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.960
nothing like that.

209
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.720
What in the case when

210
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
there is no coupon.

211
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.040
So this is the value

212
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.120
which takes care of that.

213
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.080
If there is no coupons or you

214
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.160
are not able to access this

215
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.520
key, then the percentage is

216
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.360
zero and the fixed is zero.

217
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.760
That is all very,

218
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.920
very strange syntax.

219
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.320
But just wanted to get you

220
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.480
through with this one.

221
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.320
Now how can we calculate discount

222
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
based on this interesting question,

223
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.920
but it's now a math question.

224
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.240
So we'll just go ahead and say

225
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.960
the discount that you are getting is

226
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.980
again whoever is the user and we

227
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.780
want to access the key of total.

228
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.020
Remember the total.

229
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.780
Yep, that what I get.

230
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.420
And in that we are going

231
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.780
to multiply it by percent

232
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.300
and we are going to add a fixed one.

233
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.540
Maybe we have both, maybe

234
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.700
we don't have both.

235
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.900
And then finally we have

236
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.940
the discount calculated.

237
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.100
So you can subtract between

238
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.740
the total and all these things.

239
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.060
I'll just print out a statement

240
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.980
because I want to see all

241
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.580
the values so you can do the math

242
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.780
calculation of subtracting.

243
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.340
Pretty easy.

244
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.550
I will just go ahead and say I

245
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.470
want a user and not any user.

246
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.070
I want to get the ID of it.

247
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.710
So I'll just say id.

248
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.550
So make sure you mention the key

249
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.870
and once we have this

250
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.030
so I'll just say paid.

251
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.310
Next key will be user.

252
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.790
Again the key that I want to

253
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.550
access is total and we'll get

254
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.470
out of it and got discount for

255
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.890
next visit of rupees and then we

256
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.090
simply go ahead and put up a

257
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.490
discount.

258
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.490
There we go.

259
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.250
So I hope this is a little

260
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.970
bit of a too much but this

261
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.530
is the real world code.

262
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.130
I don't want to show you just the toy

263
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.890
applications and the toy projects.

264
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.370
Sometimes it's a lot.

265
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.810
But I hope you get this what we

266
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.370
are seeing and what we have done.

267
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.290
So we have got the discounts

268
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.810
and we got the get

269
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.210
what discounts you want to get.

270
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.300
Whatever the value.

271
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.020
There could be multiple

272
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.140
values repeating and this

273
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.140
code will still work.

274
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.740
This is highly scalable code.

275
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.940
Let's go ahead and save this

276
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.540
and try to run this and see

277
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.140
if we are doing any good.

278
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.020
This is 10th dictionary

279
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.980
and there we go.

280
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.060
So the one, the ID one we should

281
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.780
actually mention the ID but anyways

282
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.420
paid 100 and got a discount

283
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.220
for next visit of 20.

284
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.820
So this is what we have.

285
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.660
So 20 this is what we have.

286
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.670
150 got a discount of 75

287
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.470
because it's a 50% off.

288
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.470
And the third one which paid 80

289
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.470
got a discount of rupees 10.

290
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.670
So hope you can see how

291
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.160
scalable this code is.

292
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.710
We can keep on adding the discount.

293
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.670
We don't worry about

294
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.030
which code gets it.

295
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.590
It needs to have an entry in

296
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.150
the discount and then you can give

297
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.789
the coupon code to any of the user.

298
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.150
So it's a very very interesting point

299
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.630
of how this is being done.

300
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.549
I hope you got the idea of this.

301
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.350
So pretty nice, pretty

302
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.470
interesting part of it.

303
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.270
Hope you all got it.

304
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.470
That is it for this video and let's

305
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.750
catch up in the next one.
