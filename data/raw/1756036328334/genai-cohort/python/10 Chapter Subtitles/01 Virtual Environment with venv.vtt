00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.080
Hey there everyone,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.000
and welcome to the video.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.880
In this video we are going

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.000
to learn how we can create

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.920
a virtual environment in Python.

6
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.600
And just want to heads up on that

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.000
that there are many ways of

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.440
creating virtual environment and

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.919
there are variety of tools

10
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.360
available to create virtual

11
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.280
environments and we're going to

12
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.880
see all of them, but we have to

13
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.520
start somewhere.

14
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.240
So we're going to start

15
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.720
with the most commonly used.

16
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.440
As of now I am moving

17
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.400
on to the new tool.

18
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.680
Actually, I'll be honest with

19
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.230
you, I now prefer to use UV

20
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900
and as a virtual environment tool

21
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.260
I will definitely cover that

22
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.100
up eventually in the series.

23
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.700
But I would want you to

24
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.300
have an experience where

25
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.140
everybody is going right now.

26
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.500
So majority of people haven't

27
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.900
moved on to the uv that's

28
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.220
latest and cutting edge.

29
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.030
Majority of the people use

30
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.180
pip, VENV as a tool.

31
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.740
I will walk you through how we can

32
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.260
work with that and you will also

33
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.060
learn how you can install other

34
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.140
dependencies as well with this.

35
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.830
So, so first of all let's go on

36
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.430
to the screen and try to understand

37
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.590
that why anybody would want

38
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.790
to have a virtual environment.

39
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.470
So there is a simple

40
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.830
explanation for this.

41
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.630
Let's just say this is your

42
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.450
machine, a pretty big one.

43
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.910
This is your machine and I happen

44
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.590
to call everything as a machine.

45
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.230
You can feel free

46
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.310
to call it as computer.

47
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.270
This is my old habit

48
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.830
of calling computers as machine.

49
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.030
I love to call them

50
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.870
and I have a habit of this.

51
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.310
So in this machine, let's

52
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.110
just say you go ahead

53
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.790
and install a Python version.

54
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.230
So we go ahead and say, hey,

55
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.710
now I have installed Python

56
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.650
in my machine, this is my Python.

57
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.170
And along with the Python,

58
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.130
let's just say you are working

59
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.610
on something interesting which

60
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.090
includes database as well.

61
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730
So we'll just go ahead and say we are

62
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.050
working on postgres as a database.

63
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.610
All right, no problem at all.

64
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.290
We can go ahead and install all of

65
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.330
them and keep on working with them.

66
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.610
But there is a problem.

67
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.610
There is a new project and which

68
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.010
uses a different version of Python.

69
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.970
So let's just say we are going

70
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.610
to tilt this a little so that we

71
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.970
can just reference this as

72
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.290
a different version of Python.

73
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.720
How you're going to work

74
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.440
on a different version of Python.

75
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.400
All right, for this version

76
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.360
to work on, you have to uninstall

77
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.600
this version and go ahead

78
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.080
and install this version.

79
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.479
That's little bit difficult.

80
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.280
Now apart from this, that's just one

81
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.200
tip of the iceberg of the problem.

82
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
Let's just say you want to again

83
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720
go back onto the latest version.

84
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.520
So you will uninstall this and you

85
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.560
will install the latest version.

86
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.250
This is the problem, this.

87
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.570
But there could be other tools

88
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.330
as well that you want to use.

89
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.850
For example, let's just say this

90
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.650
is another utility that you have

91
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.770
installed to work on the Python.

92
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.890
This could be a utility

93
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.370
to talk to CSV files or PDF

94
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.650
files or anything else.

95
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.210
If you go ahead and want to use

96
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.050
it, you can install that using

97
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.810
Pip, which is a utility that comes

98
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690
up by default with the Python.

99
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.930
So you can go ahead and say,

100
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.970
hey, I want to install this

101
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.370
utility on my machine.

102
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.450
That's great, you can go

103
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.830
ahead and install this.

104
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.070
Similarly, there are utilities

105
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.070
like Flask, there are utilities

106
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.350
like Numpy for Data Science.

107
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.030
Now, all of them you're installing,

108
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.710
and if any one of them gets a change

109
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.950
in the version, you have

110
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.630
to actually uninstall this and have

111
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.230
to grab another version of it.

112
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.190
So this needs to go out and this new

113
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.630
version needs to come into this.

114
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.750
But maybe your other files were

115
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.830
dependent on this previous version.

116
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.310
I hope you are getting the sense

117
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.920
of why this is getting a nightmare

118
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.840
as we go further into this.

119
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.720
So what we do or what we try to

120
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.840
do is instead of doing installation

121
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.840
on the whole of my machine,

122
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.600
I really don't like to install

123
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.480
these days, even any database.

124
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.040
I use the docker for this

125
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.200
docker for another day.

126
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.240
But I don't prefer to install any

127
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.680
Python utilities on my whole system.

128
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
What I prefer to do is that,

129
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.160
hey, give me inside my computer a,

130
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.920
virtual environment.

131
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.240
This is a temporary environment

132
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.280
which you can activate

133
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.200
and deactivate based on when you are

134
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.880
using it or not using it.

135
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.160
And inside this environment, I prefer

136
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.880
to install all of my utilities,

137
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.560
so I can just go ahead and keep on

138
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.880
adding my utilities as I need them.

139
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.559
Now, this utility and whatever

140
00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.400
I'm installing on my main machine

141
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.920
have no connection at all.

142
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.520
This is a sandboxed environment.

143
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.240
This environment is not going

144
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.680
to talk to your real environment

145
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.430
or real Python installed.

146
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.020
You, you have to get a copy

147
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.620
of Python into this.

148
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.500
Luckily for us, the tools that we are

149
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.260
going to use like pip, they actually

150
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.740
go ahead and install a version

151
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.460
of Python automatically for you.

152
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.980
And on top of that, you can go

153
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.220
ahead and install any

154
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.860
further utilities, like Numpies,

155
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.060
Flask, Pandas, whatever you

156
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.620
wish, any Python utility,

157
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.300
you can go ahead and install that.

158
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.460
If you want something to be

159
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.580
on your main machine, you can

160
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.260
still use Python and PIP and install

161
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.060
that on main machine,

162
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.460
but that will not be available

163
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.600
inside your virtual environment.

164
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.280
You have to go ahead and say, hey,

165
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.560
this is my Virtual Environment.

166
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.440
This is activated and I want

167
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.760
to just work within this.

168
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.640
Once I'm done working

169
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.440
I can go outside.

170
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.320
Now apart from this, there

171
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.760
are also a couple of ways that

172
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.320
you create a special file.

173
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.879
And the name of this file,

174
00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.480
at least for the initial one, is

175
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.680
called as requirement Txt.

176
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.520
This file has nothing, it

177
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.600
just has all the things

178
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600
that you're installing.

179
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.200
So as soon as you install something

180
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.560
you go ahead and mark this, that

181
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.960
hey, I want to move this

182
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.820
information that I have installed

183
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.100
this file in my requirement txt so

184
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.300
that if anybody else wants to work

185
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.660
on it they can actually consult

186
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.020
the requirement Txt and can

187
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.500
install my file.

188
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.780
I hope you are getting it.

189
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.740
It's not that hard.

190
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.900
It's just a text file

191
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.580
in which the information for all

192
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.140
of this file is available.

193
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.420
All.

194
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.260
Right, good enough.

195
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.860
So one of the most common way

196
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.340
of installing these virtual

197
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.420
environment or creating this

198
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.100
sandbox is known as Venv.

199
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.250
Virtual Environment.

200
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.370
Yeah, that's the name.

201
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.930
But this is not the only one.

202
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.410
There are a couple of others

203
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.490
available as well and out

204
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.930
of that one of my favorite one is uv

205
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.770
and we're going to cover

206
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.530
the installation of UV as well.

207
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.570
And we'll cover both

208
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.890
Virtual Environment and uv.

209
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.780
There are others as well, like

210
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.770
there is one known as Poetry.

211
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.690
We will not cover that

212
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.890
but again there could be like

213
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.890
five others as well.

214
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.540
I don't know much about them.

215
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.660
The most common one which are

216
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.060
used in the industry are

217
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.660
Virtual Environment and uv.

218
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.580
These are the ones that

219
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.660
we are going to cover.

220
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.900
Now let's go ahead and see

221
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.380
a practical example of how

222
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.180
this actually can be done.

223
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.340
This is not really

224
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.940
that hard of a program to work

225
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.380
on with super easy.

226
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.860
Just go ahead and create a new folder

227
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.180
and we're going to create a virtual

228
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.900
environment within this folder.

229
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.980
So I'll go ahead and create

230
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.180
a new folder and I'm going

231
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.450
to call this one as Test Venv.

232
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.340
I'll actually remove this

233
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.770
folder after creating this video

234
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.210
because there's no point

235
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.890
of providing this folder.

236
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.450
It's just a configuration file.

237
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.410
You can always regenerate that.

238
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.090
Now inside this folder I would

239
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.930
like to right click and we'll click

240
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.610
on Open Integrated Terminal.

241
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.810
Now this is our Python

242
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.170
environment and terminal.

243
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.610
Let's go ahead and see that I do

244
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.970
have a Python and if I go ahead

245
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.170
and say V, I don't remember it's a

246
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.140
dash V or dash dash version I have

247
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.620
to always look for what's the

248
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.300
version?

249
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.020
Come on.

250
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.380
Oh My bad, it's actually

251
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.660
Python 3 in my case.

252
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.460
So Python 3 and I guess

253
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.900
then I can say V.

254
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.660
Again it's little difficult

255
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.700
to find it out.

256
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.660
I usually don't check

257
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.500
the versions like this.

258
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.260
But anyways, so we'll just kill

259
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.020
this and I will walk you through

260
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.140
that how we can actually

261
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.460
generate a virtual environment.

262
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.100
So now notice here I am inside this.

263
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.140
So if I check the pwd present working

264
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.860
directory, I'm in the test vnv.

265
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.220
That's the most important part.

266
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.370
Once I'm here I have to use

267
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.410
Python 3 in my case and in your

268
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.570
case it's just Python because

269
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.370
you are on Windows and then I

270
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.290
have to provide an option of

271
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.370
dash that I want to use a module

272
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.130
with Python.

273
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.770
The module name is venv and I want

274
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.170
to create a virtual environment.

275
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.210
Now virtual environment

276
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.010
will like to keep some of the files

277
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.770
and Python installations somewhere

278
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.250
in your directory.

279
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.290
So that can be kept in any directory.

280
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.850
Some people like to call it as dot

281
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.890
venv Some people like

282
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.570
to call it as directly venv.

283
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.770
Whatever you do, there is no

284
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.170
right or wrong in this one.

285
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.610
As soon as I hit enter you will

286
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.730
notice that this will take a

287
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.250
second, but if I open this up

288
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.770
folder now I do have this venv

289
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.970
and I have bin include lib all

290
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.730
of this.

291
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.650
This whole thing actually is

292
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.730
saying that hey, you have

293
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.130
a Python 3.1.3.2 version, we can

294
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.290
change the versions as well.

295
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880
Apart from this we have this bin

296
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.840
and inside the bin you

297
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.880
can see that we have this

298
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.600
activate script as well.

299
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.320
We have the pip and a whole

300
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.559
bunch of other things.

301
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.480
Now the next thing that

302
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.840
you have to do is go inside

303
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.840
this venv and activate

304
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.880
your virtual environment.

305
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.799
Right now it's not activated.

306
00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.000
So first I'll walk you through how

307
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.480
you can do that in Windows and then

308
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.000
I will walk you through that how

309
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.120
we can do that on Mac and Linux.

310
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.120
So Windows user, your file

311
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.150
environment is venv v Env.

312
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.990
Go inside that, then you can just

313
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.670
press the forward slash, that's

314
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.430
a Windows thing and you will have

315
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.870
something known as script and this

316
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.430
always remains exactly same.

317
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.030
So inside the scripts you

318
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.950
will further can have

319
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.190
a forward slash and activate.

320
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.150
As long as you just

321
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.750
press this, that is it.

322
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.910
You will activate your

323
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.990
virtual environment.

324
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.910
If any point you want to deactivate

325
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.950
it, just write deactivate, hit Enter

326
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.620
and that's it for if you're on Linux

327
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.020
or a Mac, then you have to write

328
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.540
source in front of it and then we

329
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.060
will go again, exactly in the same

330
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.060
directory.

331
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.220
For in our case it's venv.

332
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.220
Venv.

333
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.420
And then we know that

334
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.380
it's inside the bin.

335
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.620
So let's go inside Bin and then

336
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.020
again the same file activate as

337
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.820
soon as I hit enter for this.

338
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.020
Oops, my bad.

339
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.980
The file name is actually venv.

340
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.860
I missed a V.

341
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.760
And there we go.

342
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.040
Notice here it says Venv

343
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.280
at the very start of it.

344
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.240
This means the virtual

345
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.560
environment is active.

346
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.240
Now I can go ahead and run

347
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.600
all these commands which we

348
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.240
are going to see in a second.

349
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.280
And now let's go ahead and see that.

350
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.200
Can I go ahead and deactivate it?

351
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.720
Yes, the command is same,

352
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.520
deactivate and hit enter.

353
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.960
That's it.

354
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.600
Your virtual environment is gone.

355
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.200
So what just happened?

356
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.840
You just asked your terminal that,

357
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.200
hey, I want to be inside this box or

358
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.720
I want to be in the whole machine.

359
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.140
So this whole machine is your

360
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.060
basic Python where you have

361
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.420
installed, but we have a one copy

362
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.900
of Python installed in our

363
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.500
virtual environment as well.

364
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.100
So we are into this Venv.

365
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.740
Let's go ahead and try this again.

366
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.220
Source Venv Bin Activate.

367
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.140
So if you're calling it as

368
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.660
vnv, go inside that folder.

369
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.740
If you're calling it as

370
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.660
vnv, go inside that folder.

371
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.340
Windows, exactly same,

372
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.340
just the path is forward slashed.

373
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.100
All right, now sometimes what will

374
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.820
happen that your VS code might not

375
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.940
be able to detect the whole thing

376
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.700
that hey, we haven't seen that.

377
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.740
Where is your virtual environment?

378
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840
In that case you can just go ahead

379
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.760
and say pwd as a present working

380
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.960
directory, copy this whole thing

381
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.480
along with this whole thing.

382
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.200
Because this is where

383
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.480
your Activate file is.

384
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.440
And at least you have

385
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.080
to walk till the bin.

386
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.160
And then what you can do is

387
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.200
let me just go ahead

388
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.480
and run the command again.

389
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.520
Let's just say I have

390
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.640
copied this whole thing.

391
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.520
Copy that.

392
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.400
And then press on your VS

393
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.760
code command shift P.

394
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.080
If you're on the Mac or Control

395
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.180
Shift, push on Windows and this will

396
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.940
open up this whole terminal thing.

397
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.500
And then write Select Interpreter.

398
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.820
This is the first thing that will

399
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.620
come to you, the select interpreter.

400
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.220
Click on this and then you

401
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.260
can actually go ahead and create

402
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.940
a virtual environment

403
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.180
from here as well, which I

404
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.300
usually don't recommend.

405
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.180
And then you have to enter the path

406
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.740
you can select from the recommended

407
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.260
one which will select a few for you.

408
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.860
Like there's one in the user

409
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.260
Bin, there's one Anaconda

410
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.540
installation as well.

411
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.140
But if you click on Enter the path

412
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.540
now you can just enter the path.

413
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.060
So Whatever we have copied using pwd,

414
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.100
just place that and then we

415
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.740
know that inside this we have

416
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.740
venv and we have a slash bin.

417
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.380
This is where my activate script is.

418
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.860
So you can just give that path.

419
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.100
In my case it has already

420
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.460
activated, so I'm fine with that.

421
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.180
But this is also another way of

422
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.580
activating your virtual environment.

423
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.700
Sometimes when we do that, you will

424
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.780
notice that with the uv, it

425
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.460
sometimes is not able to recognize

426
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.700
this virtual environment because

427
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.940
the flow of UV is kind of fresh.

428
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.340
It's not that much known

429
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.500
by the interpreters and VS code.

430
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.700
So it happens.

431
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.060
All right, let's go back.

432
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.340
And this is the basic

433
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.220
of virtual environment.

434
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.860
Now the interesting part is what can

435
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.660
I do with this virtual environment?

436
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.100
You can do a lot of stuff.

437
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.980
First and most common stuff is

438
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.340
now first of all, I don't have

439
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.700
to say Python 3 now because we

440
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.820
are in this virtual environment

441
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.380
and it's exactly same for you

442
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.340
and me whether you are on

443
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.060
Windows, I'm, on Mac, doesn't

444
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.740
really matter for all of us it's

445
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.660
just Python now.

446
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.260
And another utility

447
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.780
that we have is pip.

448
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.340
So if you just write, hit PIP

449
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.460
and enter, you are going

450
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.780
to notice that we have the PIP

451
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.780
installed and this is how

452
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.260
we can run this command.

453
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.259
Let's go ahead and run

454
00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:55.260
the PIP command.

455
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.380
So I will say that hey pip, I want

456
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.580
to install the PIP, which is already

457
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.980
installed, but I want to upgrade it.

458
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.300
So I can just go ahead and provide

459
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.430
a flag of dash dash so it will get

460
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.550
me a latest version of the pip.

461
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.910
And you will notice it says

462
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.990
you have installed Python

463
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.390
package global environment.

464
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.470
You may have that and conflicts.

465
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.270
Would you like to create

466
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.870
Virtual environment?

467
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.230
No, I am already on Virtual

468
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.870
environment, so please

469
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.510
ignore this message.

470
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.750
Now we have the latest version

471
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.870
of pip, being installed.

472
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.670
I can install dependencies with it.

473
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.150
I can go ahead and say pip, install

474
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.390
and whatever I want to install.

475
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.510
That is nice.

476
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.790
Let's just say there is a package

477
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.150
known as Request which

478
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.450
helps you to make web request.

479
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.290
I can go ahead and install this.

480
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.330
That is it.

481
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.530
It will go ahead,

482
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.850
take the dependencies, sub

483
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.250
dependencies, everything.

484
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:41.930
There is another

485
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.930
package known as Flask.

486
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.450
So I can go ahead and say I want to

487
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.610
install Flask or Django or Fast API.

488
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.410
There are so many of them, I can go

489
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.850
ahead and enter this and this will

490
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.410
install this package as well.

491
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.050
Now most important part is I'm

492
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.170
installing these packages

493
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.570
in the virtual environment,

494
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.770
not in the main environment.

495
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.620
So if I go outside of this and I say

496
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.660
that hey, I want to use request or

497
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.260
Flask, they are not available to me.

498
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.300
They're available within

499
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.100
this virtual environment.

500
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.700
And sometimes people don't ship

501
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.140
this venv they simply ship a file

502
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.300
which we just studied that

503
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.420
requirement txt that if you want

504
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.700
to know what all things are

505
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.740
installed in my virtual

506
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.420
environment, I will give you a

507
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.060
file and take consultancy with

508
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.580
this file and install all the

509
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.820
things which are mentioned there.

510
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.630
How do we generate this file?

511
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.990
PIP can actually generate

512
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.110
that file very easily.

513
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.150
The command that we want

514
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.630
to use is PIP Freeze.

515
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.990
If you enter the PIP freeze

516
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.990
command you will notice that

517
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.670
these are all the dependencies

518
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.990
which we have installed.

519
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.270
And you might be wondering,

520
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.590
hey, we didn't install this

521
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.230
much, we only installed Flask.

522
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.510
All right, that is there.

523
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.990
We also install request.

524
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.710
But what are the other things?

525
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.110
Now when you install Flask

526
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.150
or request, they are not

527
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.350
the alone that comes up.

528
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.710
Sometimes they are sub dependent

529
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.960
on other modules of Python.

530
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.360
They also need to be installed.

531
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.560
In this case that's exactly

532
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.960
what PIP has done for you.

533
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.840
It has gone ahead and installed

534
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.240
all these dependencies or

535
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.680
sub dependencies for you.

536
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.320
And in order to work all of this we

537
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.680
need to actually grab all of this.

538
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.800
Now here's a command.

539
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280
Once we know that PIP freeze

540
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.160
command exists, we can redirect it

541
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.240
into any file.

542
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.360
And this is a Linux based utility.

543
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.480
What we are going here is

544
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.800
a Linux based utility which

545
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.460
comes in Python as well.

546
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:19.980
So again, if you are

547
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.940
in Windows it will work.

548
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.900
If you are in a Mac or

549
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.740
Linux it will work.

550
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.420
But remember this whole thing,

551
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.740
a lot of people think that this

552
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.020
is a Python specific thing.

553
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.580
It is not.

554
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.660
It is a Linux.

555
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.660
We are just redirecting the output

556
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.340
of this command in a file.

557
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.860
That is all we are doing.

558
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.300
I still wonder that so many

559
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.020
people who are so much experienced

560
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.180
in Python don't know this

561
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.340
requirements txt and this doesn't

562
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.900
need to be requirement txt.

563
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.540
You can call it as dependencies

564
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.420
txt or install txt.

565
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.740
Whatever you wish to call, you

566
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.210
can just go ahead and call this.

567
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.010
This is just a kind of a philosophy

568
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.170
that people use that hey, let's

569
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.010
call this as requirement txt.

570
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.490
If I hit it enter what

571
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.210
you will notice.

572
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.610
Now inside this file we have this

573
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.530
requirement txt and all

574
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.410
of the files are available to me.

575
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.490
If I install anything I have to go

576
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.450
ahead and repeat this process again.

577
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.370
Super simple, super easy.

578
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.970
Now I can go ahead and install

579
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.370
from this and you can

580
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.370
just go ahead and say hey, I

581
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.210
want to install all this.

582
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.100
Or you can install them one by one

583
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.940
along with the version

584
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.410
and everything we will see this,

585
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.940
some of the stuff as well.

586
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.900
But this is all.

587
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.860
Now I can go back and say that,

588
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.500
hey, I want to deactivate it.

589
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.980
So go ahead and say deactivate

590
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.300
and that is all.

591
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.900
Now you are outside of this.

592
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.630
Notice the venv also is gone.

593
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.460
But again, that's not

594
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.820
a true check of this.

595
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.620
Always check that.

596
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.980
Hey, whether the Python version

597
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.340
that we are installing is different

598
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.180
or not, or just kill this.

599
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.660
And by the way, one more interesting

600
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.170
thing I want to walk you through.

601
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.730
If I go ahead and activate this

602
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.810
command again, source activate.

603
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.290
And if you're thinking that,

604
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.290
hey, I'll just go ahead

605
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.610
and kill this terminal and I will

606
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.970
start another terminal.

607
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.170
Notice here, this terminal which

608
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.850
you're going for, this doesn't have

609
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.969
this virtual environment because

610
00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:01.850
you're opening the folder terminal

611
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.810
in the root of this.

612
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.810
But we have the virtual

613
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.849
environment in the test vnv.

614
00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:06.970
Now let's go ahead and open

615
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.810
an integrated terminal here and you

616
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.490
will notice your terminal is gone.

617
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.650
Sometimes it goes away,

618
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.589
sometimes it doesn't go away.

619
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.589
So make sure you're aware

620
00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.550
of whether the virtual

621
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.069
environment is activate or not.

622
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.470
Always pay attention to this.

623
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.670
And I can run this.

624
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.270
And there we go.

625
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.950
Our virtual environment is activated.

626
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.470
Now I can go ahead and install

627
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.750
whatever I wish to do.

628
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.670
Let's go ahead and say deactivate.

629
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.790
And it's gone now.

630
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.190
Now sometimes, again, remember,

631
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.910
sometimes it goes away by

632
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.830
killing the terminal,

633
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.150
sometimes it doesn't go away.

634
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.590
And that's it.

635
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.150
Told you.

636
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.910
That is the reason why I said I won't

637
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.460
be giving you this file because

638
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.060
there is nothing inside this file.

639
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.980
It is absolutely the basic.

640
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.540
I'll, go ahead and delete

641
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.780
this because we don't

642
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.140
need it technically.

643
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.740
I hope you got the idea

644
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.380
of why the virtual environments

645
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.700
are important and what

646
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.060
they do and how it works.

647
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.219
Now UV also does exactly same.

648
00:17:56.219 --> 00:17:57.980
We have this sandbox environment.

649
00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.460
We can install the utilities, but uv,

650
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.020
instead of using the requirement

651
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.220
txt, it uses a different file name.

652
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.220
Rest of the process is exactly same.

653
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.280
All right, hope you have enjoyed

654
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.560
this video and this was very

655
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.920
beneficial for you to understand

656
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.440
the virtual environments.

657
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.640
That is it for this video.

658
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640
Let's go ahead and catch

659
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.560
up in the next one.
