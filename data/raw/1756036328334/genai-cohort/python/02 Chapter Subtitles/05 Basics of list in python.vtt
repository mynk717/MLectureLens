00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.240
Hey there, Hitesh here and welcome

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.920
to another video of Python learning.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.520
Now, this video, or from this video

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.400
onwards we start another section.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.760
I know the video is still

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.360
in the section of the Udemy,

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.000
but so far what we have studied

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
are immutable sections.

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.680
That means they cannot be changed

10
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.920
once the memory reference

11
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.560
is done, that is means it's

12
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.960
done, it cannot be changed.

13
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.200
Yes, you can create the fresh

14
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.360
one and have a reference

15
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.120
of it, just like number two is

16
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.670
being changed to number three.

17
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.790
Surely that can be done.

18
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.070
But the whole goal is once

19
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.150
a memory reference is done,

20
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.189
it cannot be changed.

21
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.270
It gets a unique id.

22
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270
That unique ID never changes that.

23
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030
Now there are other type of things

24
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.550
as well, data types which are known

25
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.430
as mutable, they can be changed

26
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.790
and that's exactly what we're going

27
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.310
to study from here onwards.

28
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.070
There are not much of them, but yes,

29
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.070
a lot more methods exist of them,

30
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.670
a lot more functionality exist

31
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.310
on them because they can be changed.

32
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.750
So there can be append method,

33
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.230
there can be insert method.

34
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.690
A lot of them exist

35
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.530
just because they are mutable.

36
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.650
That's what we are going

37
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.770
to study and I highly request

38
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.530
you that please do review us.

39
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.810
We want to make it world's

40
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.610
best Python course.

41
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.610
We are working really hard

42
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.210
on it and your support will

43
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.530
help us to make that.

44
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.810
Let's go onto the screen

45
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.410
and discuss about this.

46
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.650
So let's talk about them.

47
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.290
So there are mutables and there

48
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.300
are immutables as well.

49
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.130
We are going to the mutable or

50
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.180
journey now first let's write that.

51
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.180
That would be super fun

52
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.180
to write actually.

53
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.580
So this one that you have is mutable.

54
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.940
There we go.

55
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.540
So the first sequence that we're

56
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.980
going to study in the mutable

57
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.860
data type is going to be list.

58
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.020
Now list has variety of name.

59
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.620
I'll call this some, list

60
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.460
but you will find as an alternate

61
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.140
name or the neighbor cousin

62
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.380
in another language known as array.

63
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.100
We don't call it as an array

64
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.460
in the world of Python we call

65
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.300
it as list but treatment.

66
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.380
The defining way the data structure

67
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.100
is exactly same, there is no

68
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.140
difference between the list

69
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.300
and the array and we can actually

70
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.100
mix and match things into it.

71
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.780
And that's it, that is it.

72
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.100
We can reorder them, change

73
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.460
them because they are mutable.

74
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.100
I think let's go ahead

75
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.220
and talk about them.

76
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.820
I think rest can be discussed

77
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.100
on the code editor, which is better.

78
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.020
All right, so let's close

79
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.420
all of this and another

80
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.620
chapter in the data type.

81
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.580
Look at this, how many

82
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.240
chapters we are going for.

83
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.720
Too many.

84
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.200
Chapter 8 Py.

85
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.920
There we go.

86
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.760
So what is this list?

87
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.720
Let's just say I want

88
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.440
to call ingredients.

89
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.000
I sometimes have a tough time

90
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360
in spelling it out.

91
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.800
Hopefully I did a correct job.

92
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920
Ingredients shouldn't have used that.

93
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.760
But anyways we have to because that's

94
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040
the ingredients of making a good T.

95
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.400
Let's just say we have water

96
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.040
and what do we have?

97
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.520
Milk.

98
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.920
I don't prefer milk in my T.

99
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.050
But still I will consider this.

100
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.450
And let's just say we

101
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.930
have a black T as well.

102
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.290
These are my ingredients.

103
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.730
Now let's just say this

104
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.770
is what we have defined.

105
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.370
That is it.

106
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.890
That's what we want to have.

107
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.410
And I'll focus up here.

108
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.930
Now let's just say you

109
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.090
forgot to add sugar.

110
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.810
So what we are going to do if it

111
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.490
would be tuple, I had no choice.

112
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.170
I had to come up here and add it

113
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.490
here because once it is defined,

114
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.730
I cannot change it throughout

115
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.890
the lifecycle of a program.

116
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.260
But in the world of mutable

117
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.100
sequences and mutable data

118
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.660
types, that's not the case.

119
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.980
I can just go ahead and say

120
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.140
hey, ingredients, I want

121
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.060
to add one more thing.

122
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.340
That means I want to append it.

123
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.340
Append will add it

124
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.700
at the very end of it.

125
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.820
What do you want to append?

126
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.460
I want to add sugar,

127
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.140
or append sugar into this one.

128
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.220
That is it.

129
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.740
And let's just say

130
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.100
let's print it first because I

131
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.980
think that would be fun.

132
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.420
So printing a formatted string.

133
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.110
And I would say ingredients are.

134
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.030
And then we can use a variable here.

135
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.670
There we go.

136
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.390
So we are printing it up now.

137
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.910
Not only just we can add things,

138
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.390
we can remove the things as well.

139
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.710
I don't know who would love

140
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.870
to remove it, but let's just say

141
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.310
I want to remove the water.

142
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.030
So all I do is put up a dot and I

143
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.350
can see all the method that are

144
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.430
available here for me to use

145
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.070
in this list or in the sequence.

146
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.990
So append, clear, count,

147
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.340
extend, index.

148
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.700
Now obviously nobody can teach

149
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.700
you all this because

150
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.220
the better way to learn about them

151
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.940
is via implementation.

152
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.100
But again most of them make sense.

153
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.860
Like we have count, it is going to

154
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.490
count how many elements are there.

155
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.300
Similarly we have

156
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.660
one known as remove.

157
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.740
So this is what we want

158
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.500
to use and just mention what

159
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.340
do you want to remove.

160
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.220
So I want to remove

161
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.180
water from this one.

162
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.380
If it will be available,

163
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.780
it will be removed no matter

164
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.340
what the position is.

165
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.860
So let's just say we are saying,

166
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.180
we have the boiling water,

167
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.460
we don't need this so we

168
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.950
can just work like this.

169
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.710
And I will just like to print this.

170
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.910
Let's see what happened.

171
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.630
All right, so this time,

172
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.910
this is chapter eight.

173
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.470
We run this and we can see that

174
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.290
we have water, milk,

175
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.330
black T and sugar is being added.

176
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.390
Because we have printed this

177
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.750
after adding the sugar

178
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.430
and then we are printing this one.

179
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.510
So again, doesn't really matter

180
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.470
if it is at the very start end.

181
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.710
It will just find it

182
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.110
and will remove it.

183
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.430
There are a lot of methods available

184
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.870
in the world of list.

185
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.550
Let's try some of them.

186
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.550
I think the best way is

187
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.790
to learn them on the go.

188
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.270
But let's just say we want

189
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.230
to have some practice on this.

190
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.230
I will say I have ginger.

191
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.070
I usually go first

192
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.430
for the ginger, always.

193
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.790
And then we have, cardamom.

194
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.430
Hopefully I wrote it correct.

195
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.350
Yeah, looks good.

196
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.750
So let's just say we want to have

197
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.310
another ingredients for chai.

198
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.670
So these are my spice options,

199
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.510
and these are my chai ingredients.

200
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.770
And, the chai ingredients are

201
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.970
water and milk.

202
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.690
That's it.

203
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.010
Water and we got milk.

204
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.210
There we go.

205
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.970
Now, first of all, what we want to do

206
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.570
is we want to add spice to our chai.

207
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.410
So how I can do that, the easiest

208
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.810
way is chai ingredients

209
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.010
can actually extend

210
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.250
to an existing list just by this.

211
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.930
And I can say spice options.

212
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.890
Pretty easy.

213
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.930
What's the output?

214
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.210
Yeah, that's a good question.

215
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.530
So I would love to just directly

216
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.570
print it without any formality.

217
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.790
I will just say, chai

218
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.950
and I will say chai ingredients.

219
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.630
Let's go ahead and print it out.

220
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.350
There we go.

221
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.030
And as you can see, we have chai

222
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.870
and we have water, milk, ginger.

223
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.470
So all of this is combined.

224
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.109
This is one of the common way that

225
00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:13.390
you might want to combine two

226
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.790
of the list and stuff like that.

227
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.030
There is another interesting stuff.

228
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.950
As you can see right now we have,

229
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.630
this is known as 0th position.

230
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.270
So on the 0th position we have

231
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.680
water, then we have milk.

232
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.000
So let me just copy this

233
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.720
and bring it onto our board.

234
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.320
So there we go.

235
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.040
So this is whole how

236
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.000
a list looks like.

237
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.560
And always remember that you

238
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360
have the 0 position first.

239
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.960
So who is at 0 position?

240
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.240
Always remember

241
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.800
that water is at 0 position.

242
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.320
Come on.

243
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.120
Can you point this?

244
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.280
Yeah, there we go.

245
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.760
And then similar to this, we

246
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.480
have position number one

247
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.120
and one position is milk.

248
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.720
Super easy.

249
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.880
Not too tough.

250
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.320
So let's just say on a certain

251
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.080
specific position, you want to add

252
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.400
something and you know the position

253
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.560
where it's going to be.

254
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.680
It's super easy.

255
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.840
I Can just go ahead and call

256
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.200
the chai ingredients and use

257
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.480
the method insert appends always

258
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.120
adds it at the very end of it.

259
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.800
But insert.

260
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.880
You have to provide what

261
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.600
position you want to add.

262
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
This position is known as index.

263
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.400
You're going to see this

264
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.680
index quite a lot.

265
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.040
So let's just say my

266
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.200
index or my position is number two.

267
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.850
And I want to add something

268
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.050
like black T here.

269
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.050
Black T, where it will

270
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.170
go ahead and add it.

271
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.930
So since this is my zero position,

272
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.610
this is my one position.

273
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.570
And I know that ginger is

274
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.370
at position number two.

275
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.290
And I have asked something to add

276
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.890
in the position of the two.

277
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.130
So obviously these things

278
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.530
will move towards the right.

279
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.650
Let's see if we are

280
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.170
actually correct or not.

281
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.410
Let's go ahead and use this quick

282
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.090
keyboard shortcuts always help.

283
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.250
So we can see that we have

284
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.930
the water, milk and black T is

285
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.410
at position number two now.

286
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.570
And obviously the ginger

287
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.210
and cardamom got shifted.

288
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.570
So this is what happens when we

289
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.210
go ahead and work like this.

290
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.050
So I'll just copy this

291
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.250
for you to compare.

292
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.450
And I think I should add it up here.

293
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.930
And there we go.

294
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.130
So we still have the water and milk.

295
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.670
So water is still at a position zero.

296
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.630
Milk is still at a position one.

297
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.750
But this time the position

298
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.430
two is for black T.

299
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.710
And there we go.

300
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.670
So this is how the basics

301
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.750
of it, how it works.

302
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.510
And in the world of list there are

303
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.430
some more details just like this.

304
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.150
Usually this is the important part.

305
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.150
But yes, there are other stuff that

306
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.590
exists and I would love to show you.

307
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.510
So let me show you some

308
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.789
of the more methods that you can use

309
00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.009
in the list.

310
00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:38.208
And let's carry that on.

311
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.328
Okay, we have inserted the list.

312
00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:42.929
Let me show you that how

313
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.889
we can remove something.

314
00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:44.208
Yeah.

315
00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:45.129
From a particular position

316
00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:46.209
that would be good to have.

317
00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:49.329
So I would say that,

318
00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:50.689
let's pop something.

319
00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:53.569
So let's just say last added.

320
00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:55.009
This is the value.

321
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:57.369
And I will use chai ingredients

322
00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.729
and I can use a method pop.

323
00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:01.409
Now what this pop actually does

324
00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:02.689
whatever is

325
00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:04.540
the last element we have.

326
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.140
So in this case we

327
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.300
have this cardamom.

328
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.900
It will remove it from the list

329
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.220
as well as it will give it to

330
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.220
you back so that you can

331
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.900
actually use it into a variable

332
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.540
and just use it wherever you

333
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.900
like, but it's emptied out from

334
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.740
the list itself.

335
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.780
Let me go ahead and show you

336
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.900
what we have in the last added

337
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.100
so that you can see it.

338
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.660
And there we go.

339
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.900
Let's run this.

340
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.820
And what we see is cardamom.

341
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.420
So cardamom is now removed

342
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.980
from the list.

343
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.740
If I just go ahead and print this

344
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.180
list again at the very end

345
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.300
of it, I know there's a lot

346
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.220
of printing that is.

347
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.860
Oops.

348
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.860
There's a lot of printing

349
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.020
that is going on.

350
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.140
But that's okay.

351
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.540
So we see that the cardamom

352
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.060
is here, but cardamom is gone

353
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.380
from the list itself.

354
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.620
And that's the whole point

355
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.420
of having the pop here.

356
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.020
Now we have another thing which

357
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020
is pretty fun is I'll show you

358
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.500
directly in the print statement.

359
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.940
I think that is also possible

360
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.180
and doable and it's actually fun.

361
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.220
I can store that into

362
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.420
a variable as well.

363
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.650
But I can use directly a method

364
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.090
known as reverse here.

365
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.010
And again it's a method, it needs

366
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.690
to execute immediately.

367
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.050
Now if I try, obviously

368
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.010
will reverse the list.

369
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.530
Not like each word will be reversed,

370
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.130
but whole list will be reversed.

371
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.970
So didn't worked out well.

372
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.090
So we have to actually

373
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.410
it doesn't return you anything.

374
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.170
That's why it's saying none here.

375
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.260
Because it doesn't return anything

376
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:24.940
in order to do.

377
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.260
So I have to actually copy this

378
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.780
and have to execute this

379
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.980
because this is mutable.

380
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.500
That means list do get changed.

381
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.660
So I have to say chai

382
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.340
ingredients reverse.

383
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.660
So whatever the value is,

384
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.620
we have reversed that.

385
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.380
And now if I print this up, it has

386
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.500
actually changed my list entirely.

387
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.340
Let's run this again so we can see.

388
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.420
Previously it was water,

389
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.860
milk, black T and ginger.

390
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.900
Now we have ginger,

391
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.620
black T, milk and water.

392
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.030
So each position is being reversed.

393
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.470
Pretty nice.

394
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.190
Pretty interesting.

395
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.470
Okay, we can also do some kind

396
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.470
of a sorting as well.

397
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.950
And for sorting as well I have

398
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.310
to use the same method.

399
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.830
Oops.

400
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.950
And I have to say

401
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.310
that I want to sort.

402
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.190
That's it.

403
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.470
And now we can actually

404
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.350
print this again.

405
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.070
So notice here we have reversed it.

406
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.550
Now we are sorting it.

407
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.630
And again these are very

408
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.030
interesting examples.

409
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.950
And again they take little bit time

410
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.970
to digest, but that's okay.

411
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.410
So we have B as a black T,

412
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.570
then we have G as a ginger, then

413
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.730
Then W for water.

414
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.490
Pretty interesting.

415
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.130
Pretty nice.

416
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.130
Pretty going good.

417
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.890
So pretty interesting stuff.

418
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.610
But what I say is this method doesn't

419
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.410
make sense as of now too much that

420
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.690
hey, why would I reverse this?

421
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.890
Why would I sort this?

422
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.370
If I had to reverse, I would have

423
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.770
written this in that order.

424
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.090
But yes, there are some points,

425
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.250
there are some times like when

426
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.770
you see the buttons which says

427
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.730
sort the items from price low to

428
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.850
high or low to high, when you

429
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.770
actually make real world

430
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.560
application, they're much easier

431
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.160
to connect with.

432
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.000
So I say Just remember them.

433
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.320
Don't sweat it out too much.

434
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.960
That is totally okay.

435
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.160
Now let me show you one.

436
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.360
Another interesting example.

437
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.600
Let's just say we have a variable

438
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.440
that calls as, sugar levels.

439
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.080
Each T shop should have sugar levels.

440
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.400
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

441
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.720
I don't know who drinks that

442
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.200
much of sugar, but maybe,

443
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.000
maybe there are people.

444
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.920
So I'll just go ahead and print

445
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.520
the stuff like this.

446
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.710
I'll format this and what I

447
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.550
can use is I can find out what

448
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.430
is the maximum out of it.

449
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.590
So maximum sugar level.

450
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.110
And again, as I say, you might be

451
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.070
thinking, hey, I know already

452
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.550
what the maximum sugar level is.

453
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.310
It's five.

454
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.510
But sometimes in the program you

455
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.030
are not aware of this array,

456
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.110
this might be coming up from the

457
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.270
database and you only want to

458
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.790
show the maximum item with the

459
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.950
highest pricing or something

460
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.670
like that.

461
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.750
So in that case you can

462
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.750
actually go ahead and use

463
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.310
the function known as max.

464
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.670
Yes, this exists directly

465
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.970
and you can pass the list to it.

466
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:44.770
So for example, our

467
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:45.770
list is sugar level.

468
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.970
So this will give me whatever

469
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.930
the maximum value of this is.

470
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.130
Pretty easy, pretty fun to work with.

471
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.930
So maximum sugar level is 5.

472
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.490
And just like this, we do

473
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.290
have a minimum as well.

474
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.490
So in case I want to find minimum

475
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.850
and you guessed it right, just

476
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.570
like this is max, we do have min.

477
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.370
So yeah, no surprise there.

478
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.210
We have the maximum sugar level.

479
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.390
We have the minimum sugar level.

480
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.910
Pretty easy, pretty fun to run.

481
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.990
Now there is one couple of more

482
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.590
things I want to discuss this.

483
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.910
And again, I'm not in a hurry.

484
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.230
That's why I say my lectures are

485
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.070
little bit longer, but they are fun.

486
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.150
Usually people prefer

487
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.790
to break these lectures into

488
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.470
two parts or three parts.

489
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.950
I think we are also running

490
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.990
a little bit higher on the time.

491
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.310
So instead of this, let's go

492
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.070
ahead and start this video

493
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.550
right here and I will show you

494
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.070
two more things and let's

495
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.950
discuss them in the next video.
