00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.400
Hey there and welcome to the Python.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.480
Now that the Python is

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
installed and you have written

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.920
at least one hello world.

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.160
Now the next topic that we need

6
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.960
to work on is virtual environment.

7
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.280
Why does it even exist and why do we

8
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.800
even have the virtual environment?

9
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.560
So let me tell you that.

10
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560
What's the story behind

11
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.480
Virtual environment?

12
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.040
It's like safeguarding your

13
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.640
application from other versions

14
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.920
and don't clutter your operating

15
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920
system and also so that your

16
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.240
program actually moves safely in

17
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.560
other environment as well on

18
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.240
Linux, on Mac or other people's

19
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.760
computer.

20
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.240
So the most important part of it is,

21
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.320
let's just say that I

22
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.920
want you to say that this is your

23
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.520
whole computer, all right?

24
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.080
And you have installed Python

25
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.480
on it, all right?

26
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.000
Once you've installed the Python, you

27
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.880
will also bring third party code.

28
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.080
Remember I told you that you

29
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.320
can actually borrow this piece

30
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.600
of code anywhere you like?

31
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520
Yeah, this is exactly like that.

32
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520
And let's just say you're

33
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.720
working and you have installed

34
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.040
Python on your computer.

35
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.520
Now you go ahead and say, hey, I want

36
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.840
to borrow this piece of code.

37
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.200
So this piece of code is installed on

38
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.260
your system, probably in an orange

39
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.020
color, and you work on that.

40
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.660
Now you will have Python programs

41
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.980
in your computer just like this.

42
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.140
This is a small piece

43
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.380
of another standalone Python program

44
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.780
that you're working on.

45
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.020
This is also another one.

46
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.180
This is also another one.

47
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.539
Now all of these Python piece of

48
00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.380
code, if they are dependent on this,

49
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.180
they have to actually go ahead

50
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.820
and communicate with this one.

51
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.660
So all of this is

52
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.380
dependent on this one.

53
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.180
And let's just say this piece

54
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.260
of code gets an update and now

55
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.700
it's not of orange color, it's

56
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.860
actually red in the color.

57
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450
But your application, at least some

58
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.530
of the application, was dependent

59
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.690
on it, on the orange version of it.

60
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.370
Now what will happen?

61
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.010
This is not going to work,

62
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.570
so this will turn purple.

63
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.770
Not a good idea, that you

64
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.250
install the whole thing,

65
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.690
whatever the dependency you need,

66
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.770
into a single place.

67
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.210
And now if there is a dependency

68
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.570
on previous version,

69
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.410
it just gets really bad.

70
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.050
What could be the alternate version

71
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.650
of this entire thing, the

72
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.050
alternate version is actually

73
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.050
super easy, that instead of just

74
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.770
installing it like this, let's go

75
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.450
ahead and turn this back into the

76
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.510
orange color.

77
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.270
And instead of everybody marking

78
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.030
this as a dependency like this,

79
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.110
we simply go ahead and say, hey

80
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.830
everybody, you get your own Python.

81
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.350
I will have Python on my whole

82
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.790
operating system, that's okay.

83
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.830
But you also get your own version

84
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.350
of the Python, the smaller version.

85
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.830
And whenever you have a dependency

86
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.310
of it, you don't install

87
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.030
the dependency on my Whole computer.

88
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.870
You actually go ahead

89
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.910
and install the dependency

90
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.270
on your system as well.

91
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.190
Now this is actually behind this.

92
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.030
So there we go.

93
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.640
And similar to this, we will have.

94
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.320
Oops, we will have

95
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.200
this dependency here.

96
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.320
So we'll just go ahead and take

97
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.440
this one here as well,

98
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.640
and this one here as well.

99
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.280
Now if this operating system

100
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.720
want to stay up here, so let's

101
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.480
just say let's turn this

102
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.280
into green, everybody is happy.

103
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.440
But this application now says, hey,

104
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.560
I want the upgraded version

105
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.080
of it and I'll be fine with this.

106
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.000
This can turn into red.

107
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.320
This application is okay,

108
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.200
but this one is still

109
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
using the orange version.

110
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.720
Maybe this one also wants to get

111
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.710
even higher version than the red.

112
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.510
Probably a yellow version of it.

113
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.550
It's not visible.

114
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.060
We'll choose another color,

115
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.710
probably sharper.

116
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.110
Yellow.

117
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.470
Yeah, this one use a yellow

118
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.910
version of the Python or any

119
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.350
sub module of the Python.

120
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.790
And this is the whole concept

121
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.910
of a virtual environment.

122
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.590
You virtually create an environment

123
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.390
and this environment is just

124
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.630
isolated for this application only.

125
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.110
It's not dependent on your

126
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.190
whole operating system.

127
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.510
You can install whatever you like

128
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.670
on your operating system, but you

129
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.950
have a virtualized environment.

130
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.810
That means for every application

131
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.530
that I create, I create a,

132
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.450
standalone Python environment.

133
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.450
And then whatever I install gets

134
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.290
installed in this ecosystem, not

135
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.610
on my whole ecosystem.

136
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.010
And that's your virtual environment.

137
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.970
I hope you love this

138
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.170
diagrammatic explanation.

139
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.250
These are super awesome.

140
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.490
I love them actually.

141
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.650
So let me walk you through that,

142
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.890
how you can actually create them.

143
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.810
There are many ways.

144
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.490
The one that I'm showing you is

145
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.330
the most common one, the first one.

146
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.690
I'll show you the most latest

147
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.050
one as well, which is my favorite

148
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.050
and you will also love that.

149
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.550
And that piece of tech as well.

150
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.470
The most important and the easy way

151
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.910
of having this is first, let's

152
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.070
just say we want to have a folder.

153
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.710
We're going to call this

154
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.270
one as 01, not minus 1 01.

155
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.110
And we're going to call

156
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.910
this one as, virtual.

157
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.470
Feel free to name it

158
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.709
whatever you like.

159
00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.510
The easy way is right click on this

160
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.150
and open the integrator terminal.

161
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.390
Now you will have a terminal or

162
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.510
also known as command line opened

163
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.149
up in this particular folder.

164
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.610
So I do have Python

165
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.450
installed on my system.

166
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.570
I can just verify it.

167
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.649
I'm on the Mac, so I have

168
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.490
to say Python 3.

169
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.370
If you're on Windows,

170
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.170
just say Python.

171
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.770
So I'll just say Python 3.

172
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.580
Just give it option dash

173
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.570
And then we will use

174
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.890
a program which automatically

175
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.730
comes up, which is venv.

176
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.170
This is known as Virtual Environment.

177
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.650
Now, in what folder or in what

178
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.010
directory you want to install

179
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.970
this virtual environment.

180
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.330
Remember I told you we will

181
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.450
install this in yellow one.

182
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.300
We will install this in, in this one.

183
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.420
Whatever you want to call

184
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.340
this one, you can just go

185
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.260
ahead and call this one.

186
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.580
Usually you'll see that either people

187
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.100
call it also Venv, the same name,

188
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.820
or some people call it as venv.

189
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.060
Just to make sure that it's hidden

190
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.460
from your regular files.

191
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.420
That's the only reason for creating,

192
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.540
you can call it Superman.

193
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.660
No problem there.

194
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.620
Once I hit Enter, this actually goes

195
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.180
ahead and create this whole thing.

196
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.380
Now notice here it

197
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.300
created a new folder.

198
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.540
I'll create one more folder here

199
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.210
so that it looks nice

200
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.090
and I'll call this one as temp, or I

201
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.290
can call this as src for Source.

202
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.290
And now you can see that we have this

203
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.050
whole virtual environment folder.

204
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.530
This actually creates a separate

205
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.490
version of the Python in itself.

206
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.730
Now this has just created

207
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.250
it, it's not activated.

208
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.610
Currently you're using the Python

209
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.530
version, which is installed

210
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.610
in my whole computer, not the small

211
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.530
box here to activate it.

212
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.130
There are actually two commands, one

213
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.410
for Mac, one for Windows.

214
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.530
You can use any one of them.

215
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.250
First I'll walk through

216
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.010
with the Windows.

217
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.460
So name your folder,

218
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.780
call it as vnv, Env.

219
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.660
Whatever you have named your

220
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.620
folder, I have called it as Venv.

221
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.180
So I'll name this one.

222
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.140
Then on the Windows and again it's

223
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.180
always same, it's a forward slash.

224
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.940
Then you have to go

225
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.260
ahead and say scripts.

226
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.380
You will have a folder.

227
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.540
So go ahead and open this

228
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.980
up and see the folder and inside

229
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.780
the scripts you have slash,

230
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.860
again forward slash and activate.

231
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.140
This is how you activate your

232
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.330
virtual environment

233
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.010
in Windows if you're on the Mac.

234
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.010
What I have to do is say Source.

235
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.770
That is how you load this.

236
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.010
Then I can see I do

237
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.930
have a bin folder.

238
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.290
So I'll go inside the bin.

239
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.010
Not like that.

240
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.370
So source.

241
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.810
And then I'll go ahead and say

242
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.010
first let's go ahead and dot, venv.

243
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.210
Then I'll go inside the Bin

244
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.570
folder and in the Bin I can see

245
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.170
that I do have an activate.

246
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.170
So just open this one.

247
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.810
This activate.

248
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.050
This is the file that I want to run.

249
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.770
So I'll just go ahead

250
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.650
and say activate.

251
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.570
Once I hit Enter, you will see

252
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.610
something like this parenthesis vnv.

253
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.610
That means now you are not

254
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.810
in my computer's Python, but you are

255
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.810
into the virtual environment.

256
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.690
This is where you can install

257
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.730
and bring the third party.

258
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.530
It will not affect anything

259
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.210
that you are Bringing in one.

260
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.650
So let me also walk you through

261
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.010
now that you understand this part

262
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.010
that why this was being done.

263
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.930
To actually go ahead and install

264
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.130
a third party, I have

265
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.540
to write it better third party

266
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.580
software or third party modules.

267
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.420
So let's just say I want to bring

268
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.020
in a module of web development

269
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.580
Flask, which is very, very popular.

270
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.299
All I have to do.

271
00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:16.180
There are a couple of ways

272
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.940
how you can do this.

273
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.660
I can just go ahead now say pip

274
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.260
install and simply say

275
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.580
hey, I want to install flask.

276
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.500
It will go ahead and install flask.

277
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.020
And if I want to bring in, let's

278
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.420
just say request a module which

279
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.820
helps me to make web requests,

280
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.440
I can just go ahead and do this.

281
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.360
But there is another way.

282
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.480
Yeah, there is another way

283
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
which is more popular.

284
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.000
In this folder, whichever folder

285
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.680
you are, you actually tend to

286
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.320
create a new file known as

287
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.000
requirements Txt Again it's a

288
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.760
simple text file and there is no

289
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.040
strong reason to call it as

290
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.640
requirements.

291
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.400
It can be hitesh txt as well.

292
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.360
But I'm telling you the standard way

293
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.440
and you simply go ahead

294
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.560
and write what do you want?

295
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.400
For example, I want requests.

296
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.800
So it will install request.

297
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.860
I can have a flask and it will

298
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.780
have the flask and then I can

299
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.340
simply go ahead and say one more

300
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.860
command, pip install install.

301
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.980
But use the installation from

302
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.380
a file so dash R for the file

303
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.060
and just go ahead and say I want

304
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.580
to have this from requirements.

305
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.580
Other thing which most people does

306
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.460
is don't install

307
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.420
requests just like this.

308
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.500
They want a specific version of it.

309
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.020
Like this version will be

310
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.150
not red of course or a yellow

311
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.270
like I want to install 231310.

312
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.510
I will walk you through how they get

313
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.830
the version specifically later on.

314
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.670
But this is how they

315
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.549
mention it this one.

316
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.190
Let's just say I want

317
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.270
a version of 3.0.0.

318
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.789
There is a website from where

319
00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.950
you get all of this information.

320
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.549
So don't use sweat on it.

321
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.909
Don't you worry on that.

322
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.549
Now once I do this and if I go

323
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.390
ahead and say install this one

324
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.940
and I hit enter on this, this is

325
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.430
going to go ahead and work on it.

326
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.670
You can ignore totally this.

327
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.630
You may have installed

328
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.750
Python package in a global

329
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.110
environment, all of this.

330
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.430
So no, don't worry,

331
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.470
totally ignore it.

332
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.310
We know that 100% we are into

333
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.750
this one virtual environment.

334
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.950
It's asking us that hey, you

335
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.950
can upgrade your pip as

336
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.870
well and all of this detail.

337
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.270
But hey, rest assured that you

338
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.349
have actually installed everything

339
00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:07.310
in your virtual environment.

340
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.990
That's the reason.

341
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.550
So again It's a simple process

342
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.310
and it makes your environment

343
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.350
totally separate.

344
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.840
So we have the yellow one and in

345
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.640
this and the beauty about it, the

346
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.880
best part is now I can give this

347
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.600
software to anyone and I don't

348
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.640
have to include this virtual

349
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.440
environment.

350
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.160
They can install these dependency

351
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.520
which are required for my

352
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.680
software to run using this

353
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.640
requirement files super easy.

354
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.960
How cool is that?

355
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.600
Actually that is why I love

356
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.240
this and I will walk you through

357
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.000
with this entire process.

358
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.560
So now that you know that how you can

359
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.800
actually have a virtual environment,

360
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.360
one and only important

361
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.840
thing that I would recommend you.

362
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.690
Everyone is always work in venv.

363
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.370
That means virtual environment.

364
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.050
It is kind of a good practice and

365
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.370
a must have practice in the

366
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.890
entire Python ecosystem so that

367
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.090
your every software that you're

368
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.250
writing, every package that

369
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.330
you're writing is independent of

370
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.930
your software, independent of

371
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.610
your computer.

372
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.290
And anybody can actually install

373
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.770
your software and run through

374
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.050
it, whether Mac, Windows or

375
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.180
another system, always and always

376
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.300
work in virtual environment.

377
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.780
So we will bring this habit

378
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.340
of having virtual environment.

379
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.380
And the best part is that I don't

380
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.740
have to give this file to you.

381
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.580
Vnb, you can create a fresh virtual

382
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.060
environment, install the things

383
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.460
from the requirement and that's how

384
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.940
the softwares are being shipped.

385
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.499
We usually put it into git

386
00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:27.860
ignore, but you can just go ahead

387
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.740
and simply delete it as well.

388
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.140
But first I'll actually go

389
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.340
ahead and say deactivate so

390
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.700
that it actually deactivates

391
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.660
this virtual environment.

392
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.070
And then we'll just go ahead and say

393
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.470
hey, I will just delete this.

394
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.830
This is how softwares

395
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.470
are being shipped.

396
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.750
You actually install a fresh

397
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.950
copy through the Python

398
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.750
requirement and we ship only

399
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.910
requirements as well as we

400
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.990
ship just the Python code.

401
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.190
So this is one way of having

402
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.470
the virtual environment.

403
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.390
This is a traditional way.

404
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.310
Yes, you need to know this is

405
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.990
traditional way.

406
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.360
Traditional.

407
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.680
This is a traditional way.

408
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.320
There is also a new way

409
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.760
of installing the Python.

410
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.280
So the traditional way says that

411
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.720
you always go ahead and use venv.

412
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.040
But there is a new way as well.

413
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.160
And new way actually uses more tool

414
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.880
of the Python which is uv.

415
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.760
This is actually much, much powerful.

416
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.040
And a lot of people are loving this.

417
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.290
This is too bright.

418
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.130
A lot of people are loving

419
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.090
the UV way, including me.

420
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.530
And in the next video I will walk you

421
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.610
through that how you can actually

422
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.970
have UV to work all of this.

423
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.130
You don't have to do all of this

424
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.330
installation, everything, it

425
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.890
works much smoother than this.

426
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.290
I would prefer to teach you the UV

427
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.610
way because hey, it's modern world.

428
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.890
This was used like

429
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.170
seven, eight years ago.

430
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.810
Still, it works fine, and you will

431
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.210
see a lot of source code with this,

432
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.330
but I want to walk you through

433
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.690
with a newer way as well.

434
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.930
So in the next video I will

435
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.770
walk you through with this.

436
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.260
Probably at the very

437
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:57.980
end of the section.

438
00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.460
I still want to discuss a little

439
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.940
bit more on how to organize your

440
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.340
files and folders and structure

441
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.300
in the Python in a production way.

442
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.340
So let's talk about that first,

443
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.460
and then I will walk you through

444
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.420
with the UE as well.

445
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.380
Don't worry, I'll teach

446
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.180
you this part as well.

447
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.100
As a bonus, let's go ahead and catch

448
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.340
up in the next video.
