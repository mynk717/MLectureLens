00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi and welcome

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.000
to the Udemy's Python course.

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.400
Now let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Let me walk you through some

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.560
of the tools that I'll be using

6
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.600
for explaining the things,

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
for writing the code.

8
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.280
And don't worry, we have

9
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.320
the videos about installing

10
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.080
and doing everything

11
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.040
on Windows as well as on Mac.

12
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.120
So don't worry about that part.

13
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.840
We have covered that.

14
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.600
We have been doing

15
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.520
the teaching for like 30 years.

16
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.920
We know the drill, how

17
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.080
to work with that.

18
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.360
Now.

19
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.280
One more thing I would like to

20
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.960
mention is that I usually am down on

21
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.120
the screen on this part, but

22
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.480
sometimes when I want you to focus

23
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.180
more on the screen or entirely on

24
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.860
the screen, I just switch on to this

25
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.820
mode so that you can focus just

26
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.700
entirely on the screen.

27
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.980
But when it's required a little bit

28
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.220
of engagement or you want me

29
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.380
to see, or I want you to focus

30
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.100
on me as well, I switch it back.

31
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.020
But most of the time

32
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.740
you're going to see that.

33
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.380
Okay, you just need to focus

34
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.700
on the screen itself.

35
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.300
I want your 100% attention

36
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.260
on the screen itself.

37
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.860
So coming on that part,

38
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.740
we are going to be using VS

39
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.780
code as a code editor.

40
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.580
Go ahead and download it.

41
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.180
Don't worry.

42
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.900
We'll walk you through with

43
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.780
the installation part and Python

44
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.980
install and everything.

45
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.420
Apart from this, I also use

46
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.820
a mix of couple of tools

47
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.780
like one of them is Eraser.

48
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.460
I will provide you the link of this.

49
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.540
This helps me to teach.

50
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.740
I can draw diagrams easily and attach

51
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.260
them like these are two boxes

52
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.540
and I can just link these boxes

53
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.860
just like this and if I move one

54
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.580
box it normally goes like that.

55
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.860
This whole stuff helps me to teach.

56
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.060
This is like my whiteboard or rather

57
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.220
accurately blackboard on the screen.

58
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.220
You will find me using

59
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.660
other tools as well.

60
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.980
I don't use them that much.

61
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.420
But still if you want to know about

62
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.580
a little bit more, there's a tldraw.

63
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.500
You'll find that I draw a lot

64
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.820
of diagrams and this helps

65
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.780
people to actually learn.

66
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.870
I use Excalidraw as well,

67
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.140
in my YouTube videos extensively.

68
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.900
Not just a little bit extensively.

69
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.700
So I do have a lot of habit

70
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.140
of drawing the diagrams and stuff.

71
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.970
But for the courses specifically

72
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630
especially I prefer to use this one,

73
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.450
because it's easier to actually work

74
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.090
on with and it's generally

75
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.930
pretty interesting to work on with.

76
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.090
All right, so this is the basics

77
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.730
of it, like let's go

78
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.530
ahead and get started.

79
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.650
I don't want to waste much

80
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.370
of your time in just overviews.

81
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.009
Let's directly start with somebody

82
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.810
who has never been coded or never

83
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.130
have programmed in the life as well.

84
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.370
So let's start with the basic

85
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.650
and obvious question, what is

86
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.770
programming in itself?

87
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.130
If you have never heard or thought

88
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.170
about it in that way.

89
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.550
So programming, it's a great subject.

90
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.140
Programming is more about like giving

91
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.660
instruction to a computer

92
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.660
and especially the instruction which

93
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.740
computer do understand that is

94
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.220
the most important part of this one.

95
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.500
Computers really

96
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220
can't think on their own.

97
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220
And you might be wondering,

98
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.060
hey, AI is there.

99
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.700
They can think.

100
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.820
No, they cannot.

101
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.940
In the AI Also they just repeat

102
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.940
the steps that they have seen

103
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.720
on the Internet quite extensively.

104
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.080
And they are just fancy

105
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.760
word completions.

106
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.040
And they are pretty good

107
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.680
in that I do give you on that.

108
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.880
But they can't really think still.

109
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.680
And you have to provide them

110
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.440
exact instruction, exactly as

111
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.240
written how we'd give them so that

112
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.200
they can think a little bit.

113
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.040
So that's go for that.

114
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.000
Now let's create analogy like what

115
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.640
it's like to have a program.

116
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.760
So let's go ahead and create

117
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.320
a program for making

118
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.400
chai or T as you call now.

119
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.600
Now I usually will give you whole

120
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.480
story and example and narrative

121
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.240
throughout this course.

122
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.520
We do have, let's just say

123
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.080
a chai store or a cafe.

124
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.320
And in that we will take examples

125
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.720
of each of the exercise that

126
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.120
we do related to the chai.

127
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.399
It's one of my favorite thing.

128
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:31.080
So how are you going

129
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.760
to make the chai?

130
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.560
How you'll give computer instruction

131
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.200
about making a chai.

132
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.480
That is bit challenging,

133
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.080
but we'll try our best to actually

134
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.120
give that instruction.

135
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.210
So all right, let's go

136
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.090
ahead and buckle up.

137
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.650
You also try it along with me.

138
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.530
So step one would be

139
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.170
like gather, water.

140
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.010
All right, I got the water.

141
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.770
Then go ahead and grab some milk.

142
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.450
If you prefer to have a milk T, then

143
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.250
go ahead and grab T leaves as well.

144
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.290
So you might want

145
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.330
to have some T leaves.

146
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.890
Obviously it's a chai.

147
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.210
And then go ahead and grab sugar.

148
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.810
Maybe you like sugar T.

149
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.090
And then also go ahead and grab some

150
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.530
utensils as well.

151
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.690
So these are gathering part.

152
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.290
This is collection of the data.

153
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.690
This is the part one you have

154
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.690
to have to do this.

155
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.810
There is no exception.

156
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.250
There is nothing in that.

157
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.810
Like.

158
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.970
So this is the part one

159
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.130
of giving the instructions.

160
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.570
Hey, collect all of this.

161
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.050
Now once you have done

162
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.290
with this, then obviously

163
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.890
the job is not yet done.

164
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.410
This is just collection

165
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.450
and then we have to provide some

166
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.850
of the conditions as well.

167
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.010
So check conditions and conditions

168
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.720
could be something like we want

169
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.300
to have enough water, maybe clean

170
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.000
cups and then we have to give

171
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.240
a precise instructions after that.

172
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.240
So you can see there are a lot

173
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.160
of moving parts into the coding

174
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.240
as well just like this.

175
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.920
So making chai, you have never

176
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.240
thought about it, but this is all

177
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120
like gathering the stuff, then check

178
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.080
some condition and then finally

179
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.400
there will be thorough steps.

180
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.760
We will work on the steps as well

181
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.150
that how to actually make this tea.

182
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.870
So these are the three components

183
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.390
and these are the exactly three

184
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.990
components we are going to learn

185
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.750
throughout in this Python course.

186
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.510
Apart from this, I also would like

187
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.470
to address one more thing which is

188
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.190
is coding really that much hard?

189
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.430
This is a tangent example,

190
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.790
but I would say yes and a no.

191
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.310
Is coding truly super

192
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.510
easy walk in the park?

193
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.390
No, it is not.

194
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.680
Everybody says coding is easy,

195
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.080
but it is not that easy.

196
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.000
It requires extensive amount

197
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of effort over the years.

198
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Sometimes you will get comfortable

199
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360
within months, few months,

200
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.040
but it requires definitely couple

201
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.200
of years to truly get the hand

202
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.959
of what it takes to be programming.

203
00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.960
It's not the easiest job and that is

204
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.240
the reason why people get paid

205
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.240
highly for the computer programming.

206
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.440
I would want to have you

207
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.040
realistic aspect of this.

208
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.200
It's not going to be easy,

209
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.760
but it's surely doable.

210
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.080
And especially when the languages

211
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.520
are like Python or JavaScript,

212
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.725
they're super easy to learn.

213
00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.320
And Python specially is like

214
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.240
a language which is almost feels

215
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.520
like you know the English,

216
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.040
you know the Python, but there

217
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.840
are nuances of it, there are

218
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.600
complexities of it as well.

219
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.960
So I want you to keep very

220
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.400
realistic ground on this.

221
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.320
It is not that easy,

222
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.440
it takes time to master it.

223
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.800
But getting started writing

224
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.120
simple code is super easy.

225
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.640
You can do this within few months.

226
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.440
But again coding is all about

227
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.200
having the process, breaking down

228
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.220
the steps and, and thinking more.

229
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.220
Writing the code is the easy part.

230
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.900
Thinking about it, having the thought

231
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.340
process of a programmer, that

232
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.420
is where the real magic is and that

233
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.860
is the toughest part of it.

234
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.180
All right, so now that you know

235
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.260
about the tangent part of it, let

236
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.820
me go ahead and give you one more

237
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.579
example before we wrap this up.

238
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.900
So how would you make this

239
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.020
the steps of this?

240
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.220
So let's go ahead and try

241
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.580
to have some of the steps

242
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.740
for making the tea.

243
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.900
First of all what I would like

244
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.300
to do is check if

245
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.620
cattle, we are making the T

246
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.340
in cattle, so cattle has water.

247
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.420
So this is my step one.

248
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.940
What would be your step two?

249
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.580
And again it doesn't really matter if

250
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.060
should have five step or six step.

251
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.780
Whatever it takes.

252
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.900
Whatever it takes.

253
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.580
Then I would love to simply have

254
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.900
a, plug, plug, plug in kettle.

255
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.180
Then obviously boil, boil water.

256
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.180
So these are the basic

257
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.460
steps I would love to have.

258
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.100
Let me shift my

259
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.920
keyboard a little bit.

260
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.990
And this is the second step.

261
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.830
What would be the third step?

262
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.550
I would say get clean cup

263
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.470
or cups, whatever you like.

264
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.710
This is my third step.

265
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.710
What would be my fourth step in that?

266
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.350
Give it a shot, think a little.

267
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.110
I would be saying that add

268
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.990
T leaves so that it gets the color.

269
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.790
And probably also let's add sugar

270
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.670
to cup or maybe to boiling

271
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.750
water, whatever you prefer.

272
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.290
And after that I would have

273
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.530
something more probably.

274
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.770
Pour, boiled.

275
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.450
Oops.

276
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.690
Pour boiled water into

277
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.290
cup and then add, sugar.

278
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.530
Or if you want milk as well,

279
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.890
you can pour that as well.

280
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.270
And then I would say stir and serve.

281
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.350
So these are my steps

282
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.070
of making a tea.

283
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.310
And again, everybody's steps

284
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.190
are different and that's why

285
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.710
they say programming code

286
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.110
is different for everyone.

287
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.270
So these are my steps.

288
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.510
So as you saw, this is

289
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.830
super easy and we can have

290
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.310
the things like this.

291
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.310
So we actually turned making Chai

292
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.230
into a simple piece of code.

293
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.470
Super easy, super nice.

294
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.750
And we have a, great diagram as well.

295
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.710
There we go.

296
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.510
So we first worked on gathering

297
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.350
the things, checking

298
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.630
the condition, and then we wrote

299
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.110
the steps and we have all the steps

300
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.359
for making the table.

301
00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:43.999
And in the very next video, we

302
00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:46.239
will go ahead and try to convert

303
00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:47.879
this into a piece of code.

304
00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:50.039
It is not going to be truly

305
00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.199
a python code, we'll just

306
00:08:51.199 --> 00:08:52.439
mimic the Python code.

307
00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:53.359
This is not going to be

308
00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:54.759
accurate, but it will give you

309
00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:55.999
an idea that, okay, Python

310
00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:56.879
is not that really hard.

311
00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.679
It's super easy to work on with.

312
00:08:58.679 --> 00:08:59.559
Let's go ahead and move

313
00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.679
on to the next video.
