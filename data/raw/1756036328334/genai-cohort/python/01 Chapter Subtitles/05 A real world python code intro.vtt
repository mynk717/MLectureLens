00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.480
All right, I hope you are

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.640
enjoying this in this video also

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.560
I will introduce you

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.360
to the more code and more keywords.

5
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.880
Now don't take it too much

6
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.800
on the pressure side, take it light.

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.440
I'm just introducing you with a lot

8
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240
of keywords on the code.

9
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040
You will understand it more as we

10
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.920
grow and we got into the course.

11
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.840
But I just want you

12
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.840
to taste the Python right now.

13
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.320
We are not writing accurate

14
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.600
Python, but I just want you

15
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.640
to feel the language.

16
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.760
How does it look like?

17
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.680
It's not that scary.

18
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.840
Just type on the things

19
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.760
on the keyboard, you will

20
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.920
be all in under control.

21
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.840
Let's explore more

22
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.960
part of the Python.

23
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200
Let me take you on the screen and you

24
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.960
will get to know more about it.

25
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.160
So we'll explore a little

26
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.280
bit about the Python.

27
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.280
Objects, properties, methods.

28
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.800
So what this is all about,

29
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.800
so whatever we have written here,

30
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.360
like boil waters, this is function.

31
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.840
This is also known as methods.

32
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360
So it wouldn't be wrong if

33
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.800
I just go ahead and name this

34
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560
whole thing as a method.

35
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.110
Yeah, method or call it as function.

36
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.430
These are like interchangeably terms.

37
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.750
So again, this makechai

38
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.110
is also a function.

39
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.710
And this whole fill kettle,

40
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.070
this is also a function.

41
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.470
Anything that has parenthesis,

42
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.710
this is a function.

43
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.150
Now, not all the time, we actually

44
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.190
write functions like this.

45
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.150
Sometimes we actually

46
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.350
write them something like this.

47
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.270
So we have a whole big box

48
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.270
and just like we have this small

49
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.470
box up here, we actually like

50
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.190
to write a lot of these functions.

51
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.230
So imagine this is one,

52
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.030
this is another one.

53
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.750
This is another one,

54
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.470
this is another one.

55
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.750
That's exactly what we, we saw that

56
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.150
we have fill kettle, we have plug

57
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.550
in kettle, we have boil water.

58
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.950
All these are functions,

59
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.790
so consider them as like this.

60
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.070
Now when we have these kinds

61
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.110
of things as methods or properties,

62
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.950
sometimes we call this

63
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.670
outer box as another name.

64
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.710
Yeah, this is known as whole class.

65
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.550
So I'll just go ahead and name this,

66
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.550
this is known as class.

67
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.750
And class could be named

68
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.150
anything, whatever you like, like

69
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.490
chai, chai, shop, whatever.

70
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.210
So this is whole big, like a factory.

71
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
And each factory has

72
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.210
its own smaller units.

73
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.890
Would you like to actually go

74
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.090
into the depth of it?

75
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.330
Surely we will write some

76
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.890
of the example code for it so that

77
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.410
we can understand more of it.

78
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.810
Apart from this, I also want you

79
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.370
to understand couple of more things.

80
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.449
First of all, there is

81
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.090
something known as object.

82
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.610
What is an object?

83
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.050
So in the world of programming, a lot

84
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.450
of things are called as object.

85
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.690
In the real world, let's just say

86
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.500
you want to call an object a cup.

87
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.860
Definitely it's an object.

88
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.020
Probably a, kettle.

89
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.660
This is also an object,

90
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.620
or probably chai.

91
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.420
This is also in itself an object.

92
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.740
This is like a thing in the world

93
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.340
of programming in itself.

94
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.620
Apart from this, you will

95
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.980
also get to know about

96
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.540
something known as properties.

97
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.660
So what are properties?

98
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.900
Just like English, nothing else.

99
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.260
Properties is like probably cup,

100
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.300
color, that's the property,

101
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.470
or probably chai sweetness.

102
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.790
So that is also a property.

103
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.670
Yeah, as I told you, it's exactly

104
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.470
like how it is in the real world.

105
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.710
And then finally we have

106
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.350
something known as methods, or

107
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.870
we call them as functions.

108
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.910
This is the most important part.

109
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.390
This is the actionable step.

110
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.909
Or I can call this as

111
00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.470
in simple actions.

112
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.950
This is like performing something.

113
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.830
Probably you are staring

114
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.990
or you are pouring.

115
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.990
I'll just write pour, not pouring,

116
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.870
you're pouring

117
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.860
or pour or, or probably drink.

118
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.220
These are methods and this is

119
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.540
all what we're going to learn

120
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.300
in the world of Python that, okay,

121
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.380
this is all the things that I

122
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.740
have to go through and learn.

123
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.620
And yeah, this is all it

124
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.100
is all about, the Python.

125
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.820
All right, nicely

126
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.139
captured, nicely drawn.

127
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.300
I'll put up a box so that

128
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.660
when you see this, this looks

129
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.660
good, beautiful to you.

130
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.180
So a whole Python program can be

131
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.150
a mix of these classes, these

132
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.630
methods, objects and properties.

133
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.950
And that's what makes a program.

134
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.110
Can we go ahead and write

135
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.230
another fake program which doesn't

136
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.270
work, but still gives you

137
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.710
an idea of all the thing that

138
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.550
we are trying to do here.

139
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.550
Let's go ahead and try this.

140
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.430
Let's close this.

141
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.950
This is not going to work again,

142
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.510
but we can create a new file.

143
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.910
We are going to call this one as,

144
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.030
non Python Shop Py.

145
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.470
Of course, py is an extension

146
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.910
to write Python files.

147
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.580
And, and don't worry, very soon

148
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.460
we're going to again

149
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.500
see that how to actually install

150
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.380
the Python and go for it again.

151
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.260
This is also again a part where

152
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.779
I just say, just experience it.

153
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.260
And again, don't worry, you will

154
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.900
write a ton of code in the Python.

155
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.139
So right now just

156
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.580
experience it with me.

157
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.540
As I said, sometimes

158
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.460
we call it as class.

159
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.180
So this is a bigger, bigger function,

160
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.180
like big boss of a function.

161
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.780
We call this one as a chai.

162
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.300
There we go.

163
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.620
We don't put parentheses around

164
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.660
it because it's a class.

165
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.040
And as I mentioned, this

166
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.920
is exactly like this.

167
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.120
We have a class, we can

168
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.080
call it whatever you like.

169
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.760
In this case we are

170
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.800
calling it as chai.

171
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200
In this we can have multiple of

172
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680
these small factories or small area

173
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.040
in a chai shop or Just a function.

174
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.400
So let's go ahead and see

175
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.280
more keywords which

176
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.720
you haven't seen that.

177
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.600
So then we will discuss them.

178
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.680
Don't you worry.

179
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680
We actually use to underscore.

180
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.120
Then we call init.

181
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.200
Then we use to underscore again.

182
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.720
And then we put it like this.

183
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700
This means we have opened

184
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.060
the Chai factory.

185
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.620
Whenever you open a factory, it

186
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.100
requires some of the minimum things

187
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.220
in that, we will use them.

188
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.500
So whenever you open a new shop,

189
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.900
you need licenses, you need

190
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.140
some table and chair, maybe

191
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.460
a stove, something like that.

192
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.139
So we first of all, whenever we

193
00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.100
use something like this, there

194
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.300
is a keyword known as self.

195
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.020
We will go in depth of it.

196
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.060
Don't worry about it,

197
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.260
don't sweat it too much.

198
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.020
This is just an experience

199
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.640
part that what's about to come.

200
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.480
We will go in depth

201
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
of each and everything.

202
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.480
Right now just sit back, enjoy it.

203
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.440
Then whenever you open, this one,

204
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.000
you actually go ahead and divide

205
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.160
something like sweetness.

206
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.560
That okay, by default if I'll cook,

207
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.880
a T or I'll brew a T, this is going

208
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.120
to be my sweetness level.

209
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.200
This is going to be my milk level.

210
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.680
Of course customer can customize

211
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.960
it, but this is my factory.

212
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.840
I'm just setting this

213
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.320
up blueprint of it.

214
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880
So I'll just go ahead

215
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.120
and say self again.

216
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120
This is a syntax.

217
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.750
Don't worry on too much.

218
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.670
I'll just go ahead and say sweetness.

219
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.470
So whenever I make it, this is going

220
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.510
to be my sweetness again.

221
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.710
What is this syntax?

222
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.790
Don't you worry, we

223
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.030
will understand this.

224
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.950
Right now I just want

225
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.550
you to have this.

226
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.830
This is a syntax

227
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.950
similar to sweetness.

228
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.390
We are going to go ahead and have

229
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.710
the milk level of it as well.

230
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.470
We are going to go ahead and say

231
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.670
milk underscore level.

232
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.230
And we're going to go

233
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.710
ahead and say milk level.

234
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.350
So whenever I open up a factory,

235
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.270
there is a method known as init.

236
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.230
And again, this has

237
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.030
its own importance.

238
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.710
So whenever you open up a class,

239
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.550
you have to have

240
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.790
to provide an INIT method.

241
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.350
Init.

242
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.030
And that's what we are doing.

243
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.430
So class INIT means class

244
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.510
has been initialized.

245
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.990
As soon as you initialize, you

246
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.110
cannot have an empty shop.

247
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.870
There needs to be some cup,

248
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.870
some T, or some preparation

249
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.910
method, something like that.

250
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.510
So this is our preparation method.

251
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.470
If you understand it, that is okay.

252
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.430
If you not understand

253
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.430
it, please remove it.

254
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.870
As of now, we are not

255
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.550
focusing on these.

256
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.030
I just want you to have.

257
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.030
Because as many time as you're going

258
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.350
to see in the iteration these

259
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.710
words, this will make your life

260
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.750
a Little easier right now.

261
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.670
It might feel a little bit

262
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.110
overwhelming, but that's okay.

263
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.910
Then let's try to set

264
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.070
up the factories.

265
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.510
Okay, so factory number one,

266
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.190
let's call this one as sip.

267
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.430
Somebody sip the T.

268
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.310
So we're going to define

269
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.990
method computer.

270
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.670
Is that dumb?

271
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.750
You have to define everything in it.

272
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.190
And whenever you define anything

273
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.950
inside the class, you have

274
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.230
to actually get the self.

275
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.270
What is the self?

276
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.900
It has its own important meaning.

277
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.340
We will explore it, we'll

278
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.860
cut through it like in depth

279
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.380
and we'll see everything.

280
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.420
And right now we just want

281
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.540
to have a print statement.

282
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.900
You're going to see in the Python

283
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.100
a lot of printing statement.

284
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.180
Get ready for does nothing.

285
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.700
It just prints nothing

286
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.900
in a black terminal.

287
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.940
That's it.

288
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.540
Okay, so we're going

289
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.380
to say sipping chai.

290
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.100
That's it.

291
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.980
We can have another factory or a,

292
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.140
small factory for it.

293
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.140
Let's just say somebody

294
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.100
wants to add a sugar.

295
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.860
So let's just create a method for it.

296
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.180
I want you to add sugar.

297
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.470
Again, self is obviously

298
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.430
going to be always there.

299
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.790
And then we ask how much

300
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.950
amount you want to have

301
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.410
and we're going to do nothing.

302
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.270
We're going to just go ahead

303
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.110
and say print like

304
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.670
added the sugar just like it.

305
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.950
So this is the most basic part

306
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.510
of how it's being done.

307
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.950
So we have a class, we have

308
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.510
this one basic factory.

309
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.190
Then we have two of these

310
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.790
methods inside this.

311
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.150
So you can add more as well.

312
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.670
We had just added two more.

313
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.790
Feel free to add more.

314
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.870
Like maybe you want to have

315
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.950
how strong you want

316
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.630
to have T so the customer

317
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.910
can tell the amount of T.

318
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.950
Now how do we go ahead

319
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.670
and get started with this?

320
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.270
So again, a little bit more code.

321
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.870
But again just experience this.

322
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:34.549
We will go through it,

323
00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.589
we'll dissect of it.

324
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:37.630
But again I just want to have

325
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.630
you a little bit of experience.

326
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.669
People try to delay it as

327
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.789
much as I don't want.

328
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.549
I want you to have

329
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.470
at least a look that.

330
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.710
Okay, this is coming up.

331
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.910
It's okay.

332
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.670
It's okay to have this

333
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.750
much of line of code.

334
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.150
So how do we do it?

335
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.950
We simply go ahead and use this chai.

336
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.070
Remember we have used

337
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.110
the uppercase letter here.

338
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.550
So that's how we do it.

339
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.310
As soon as I make my chai,

340
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.150
this method will kick in.

341
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.990
This is init.

342
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.829
So as soon as initialized or

343
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:02.870
means you have set up a

344
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.310
factory, you have to tell me

345
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.430
how much sweet it is going to

346
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.830
be, how much the milk level is

347
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.230
going to be.

348
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.630
And again it's super easy.

349
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.870
I'LL just go ahead and say

350
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.630
that, hey, my sweetness level is

351
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.080
going to be probably three.

352
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.240
I don't know what that three is.

353
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.640
Maybe three teaspoon,

354
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640
maybe three, tablespoon.

355
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.400
I don't know, but it is something.

356
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.840
Then I also give milk level.

357
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.400
I don't know.

358
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.440
We have probably milk

359
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.880
level one, two or three.

360
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.360
I'll just say 50, 50, like

361
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.560
two portion of milk.

362
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.880
I don't know how it is.

363
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.640
And then we can store it into

364
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.160
a memory with some reference.

365
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.480
And we can call

366
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.080
with a name like my name is Hitesh.

367
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.600
Your name might be Rahul

368
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.360
or John, whatever it is.

369
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.960
So we're going to call

370
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.360
this one as my chai.

371
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:41.990
So we're going to go ahead

372
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.990
and say my underscore chai.

373
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.350
And then we're going to say equal.

374
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.750
And again, I can write that better.

375
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.830
Mychai now mychai can use or

376
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.430
can run any of these methods.

377
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.830
You don't have to say define again.

378
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.430
You just have to name the method.

379
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.470
That's it.

380
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.910
So notice here, mychai can actually

381
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.870
use a dot and it has all the methods

382
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.790
like I can add sugar, I can sip.

383
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.990
I don't want to sip right now.

384
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.950
I want to add sugar.

385
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.560
How, how much sugar you want to add?

386
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.760
I don't know, probably

387
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.960
one, probably five.

388
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.920
Whatever.

389
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.880
So again, this is really a lot

390
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.120
of code in the very first section.

391
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.320
But I want you to taste this.

392
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.200
Not the T, but the whole

393
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.360
code part of it.

394
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.800
I could have avoided this

395
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.640
and got you into the course first

396
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.320
and just get you comfortable.

397
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.320
But I want you to write the code

398
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.280
by the end of this course.

399
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.440
That's why I've written this much

400
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.840
of the code in front of it.

401
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.280
15 lines of code in the very

402
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.440
first section is usually

403
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.880
avoided by most teachers.

404
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.140
I don't, I want you

405
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.260
to get right into it.

406
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.460
So I hope you got this part that.

407
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.580
Yes, this is like an object.

408
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.220
And again now just see that whatever

409
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.660
we have done, do we have some of

410
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.340
the objects like cup, kettle, chai?

411
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.540
Yeah, probably yes.

412
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.780
A little bit of the sweetness.

413
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.300
We do have some of the cups as well.

414
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.020
Probably sipping.

415
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.260
We can add some cups.

416
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.580
We have some properties as well,

417
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.020
like chai, how much sweet it is.

418
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.300
We are manipulating these

419
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.460
properties as well.

420
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.980
We do have some methods as well,

421
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.620
like stirring, pouring, drinking.

422
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.500
So we have a drinking

423
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.840
method like sip.

424
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840
We have a method for adding

425
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.160
the sugar and we are controlling

426
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.760
some of the properties like

427
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.120
sweetness or milk.

428
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.360
So this is how a Python program

429
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.040
and believe it or not, you have

430
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.320
written a, really, really remarkable

431
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.280
and Complex Python code already.

432
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.639
This is exactly right now

433
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.040
it doesn't have a meaning.

434
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.120
But as eventually we'll go through

435
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.520
and we'll learn about the logic

436
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.880
part of it, you will be able to

437
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.840
turn everything into logic, like

438
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.000
what happens when you click on

439
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.400
the screen, what happens when you

440
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.640
move the cursor away from the

441
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:32.920
screen.

442
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.760
All of this can be controlled here,

443
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.730
and that's what I want you to see.

444
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.610
Yeah, Programming is nice and simple

445
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.050
again in this section.

446
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.490
From here onwards, we are not going

447
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.850
to be writing any more code.

448
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.810
Don't worry about it.

449
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.410
Your experience part is over.

450
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.610
But as long as you are decently

451
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.370
comfortable in this piece of

452
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.250
code, and this piece of code, you

453
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.370
probably don't write it right

454
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.450
now, but at least you understand,

455
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.170
okay, the SIP is a smaller

456
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.570
factory inside a bigger factory

457
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.770
and I can use it.

458
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.490
The add sugar is also like a small

459
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.690
factory, which does some work.

460
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.810
I don't know what work, but it

461
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.600
does some work to my program,

462
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.760
to my variables, or mean some

463
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.360
information on the program.

464
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.240
As long as you're comfortable

465
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.040
with this, that's it.

466
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.400
Your journey will be super easy

467
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.520
in the Python and this

468
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.000
is what it is coming up.

469
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.560
All right, so this is all the code

470
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.720
part for the section one.

471
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.240
Now let's go ahead and take a little

472
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.600
bit tour of the theoretical part.

473
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.000
And in the very next video,

474
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.880
we're going to learn one more thing

475
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.720
which is super important

476
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.200
for you to understand that why

477
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.480
we are going with the Python.

478
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.600
Of course you are in this course,

479
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.110
that's why we are going with it.

480
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.630
But there are other reasons that why

481
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.870
Python is getting popular and why

482
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.710
I made this course as well.

483
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.670
Let's go ahead and move on

484
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.230
to the next video

485
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.230
and explore why Python part.
