00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.960
Hi and welcome to the video

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.320
of meet your instructor.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.280
Hi, meet me.

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.240
My name is Hitesh.

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.480
I really wanted to have this

6
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.080
video because we'll be spending

7
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.320
so much of time together

8
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.960
in learning Python and we're going

9
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.640
to be enjoying this so much.

10
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.160
I really wanted to have a personal

11
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.640
connection and knowing a little

12
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.720
bit more about me and my style of

13
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.960
teaching and what I've been doing

14
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.040
in life makes our connection more

15
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.360
stronger and you'll be feeling

16
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.560
much more comfortable in the

17
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.260
course now.

18
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.660
Don't worry, I'm not going to.

19
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.260
I will not bore you too much

20
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.740
with the details of every

21
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.180
single thing, but enough that

22
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.220
you get the confidence that

23
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.380
you are in the right hand.

24
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.300
And I've been doing this

25
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.780
for a really long time.

26
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.860
My name is Satish and I did my

27
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.180
engineering in electronics

28
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.420
and communications, specifically not

29
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.820
in computer science.

30
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.180
So yes, anybody can

31
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.380
learn how to code.

32
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.700
It really is also not a walk

33
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.980
in the park, but especially

34
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.580
it's not really that difficult.

35
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.030
Anybody can learn to code now.

36
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.350
Once I finished my engineering

37
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.270
I moved into the Python ecosystem,

38
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.870
especially in the cybersecurity,

39
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.870
but then quickly moved

40
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.990
into the development role,

41
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.710
especially iOS development.

42
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.110
And then thereafter I moved

43
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.030
into web development

44
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030
and databases and JavaScript

45
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.670
and again Python based development

46
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.310
and a whole lot of things.

47
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.830
Now during my life I have done

48
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.340
a fair bit of my startups as well.

49
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.230
Some of them failed and really I love

50
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.790
to show off about them as well.

51
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.540
Two of them worked really well

52
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.950
and they got acquired

53
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.740
with a pretty big deal and I

54
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.580
enjoyed that deal after that.

55
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.060
Currently also I'm running

56
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.980
two of my startups, running

57
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.300
pretty good, one of them serving

58
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.100
around 22 million users.

59
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340
So yes we really know how to scale

60
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.139
up the things and how

61
00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.380
to write great quality softwares.

62
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.060
And apart from that I also

63
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.340
run two YouTube channels.

64
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.580
One is hitting a million

65
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.940
subscribers, it is already done

66
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.500
by the time you will be watching.

67
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.540
Another one has already crossed

68
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.080
half a million subscriber and my

69
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.920
specialty is to turn the toughest

70
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.560
topic into the easiest one.

71
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.600
I read a lot of books about teaching

72
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.120
and especially yes I do read about

73
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.480
the tech as well like Python,

74
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.960
JavaScript and all that but I also

75
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.800
read a lot about the teaching

76
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.000
mechanism, how to deliver engaging

77
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.040
content and one of my specialties

78
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.760
to turn the toughest topic into the

79
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.919
easiest one.

80
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.720
I use a lot of approach in teaching

81
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.280
like for example for frameworks and

82
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.970
library I use the approach of first

83
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.170
style of learning that is you get

84
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.250
into the details, explore every bit

85
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.010
out of it and see that oh, there is

86
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.450
no magic in this framework, go

87
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.810
inside detail and create those

88
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.610
features.

89
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.850
This is also first person

90
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.650
kind of a learning,

91
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.810
first principle learning.

92
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.530
But there is another style that I

93
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.730
have explored over the year which

94
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.650
is kind of exploration learning

95
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.250
or hunting learning and

96
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.770
experimenting learning in which

97
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.770
you just go ahead and investigate

98
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.210
the things.

99
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.690
I officially termed it as

100
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.170
investigative learning but there is

101
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.280
no official documentation about it

102
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.000
in which you try to investigate

103
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.720
the things as you write them.

104
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.240
This especially works really well

105
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.080
in the programming languages

106
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.920
and especially when

107
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.960
the ground details are required.

108
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.640
So for this entire course we'll

109
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280
be providing and we'll be focusing

110
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.200
on moreover this investigative

111
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.520
style of learning and you'll be

112
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.040
thoroughly loving this part.

113
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.280
We'll be questioning every

114
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.320
output, we'll be questioning every

115
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320
single line of code

116
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.240
that we're going to write.

117
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.880
And this is going to be one

118
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.840
of the most amazing class that you

119
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.200
have ever seen in the Python.

120
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.680
I've delivered Python

121
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.520
in the past as well in my YouTube

122
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.800
channels as well in Hindi and other

123
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.960
languages, regional.

124
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.080
But this course is exceptional.

125
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.400
I have spent months in just

126
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.320
preparing notes for this entire

127
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.480
course and then I realized now

128
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.840
that I have done my startups and

129
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.800
I enjoy teaching now I have no

130
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.920
hurry, nothing really is

131
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.840
important for me now.

132
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640
It just all sit back and relax.

133
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.320
You will truly understand

134
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.480
what it takes to truly master

135
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.840
a language like Python.

136
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.460
And I'm pretty sure you're going

137
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.420
to be enjoying this part.

138
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940
If you have any doubt anything,

139
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.380
reach me out on LinkedIn or Twitter.

140
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.300
I'm pretty much active there.

141
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.780
I tweet a lot, I spend

142
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.700
a lot of time on that.

143
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.020
So reach me out, don't hesitate

144
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.460
and if there is any topic which

145
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.660
requires more video, more knowledge

146
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.460
or more explanation or something

147
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.980
is missing, just tweet me out.

148
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.660
I would love to add that topic here.

149
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.860
So I guess that is quite more

150
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.900
than enough in the intro

151
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.890
about me and now I, I think

152
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.530
you also get that, that okay.

153
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.850
And again another thing that I would

154
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.770
like to mention about me is I enjoy

155
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.250
not just mindlessly like a robotic

156
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.329
way of just delivering the videos.

157
00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.769
I prefer to have a style in it, ups

158
00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.970
and downs on the videos and voices

159
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.290
and I love storytelling as well.

160
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.490
And my lectures are

161
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.530
a little bit laid back.

162
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.930
It's not really fast paced.

163
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.890
You're going to enjoy that.

164
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.490
If you wish you can turn me up into

165
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.610
1.5 but I prefer a laid back style

166
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.420
because your brain actually needs

167
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.180
some time to process the videos and

168
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.780
move it into the secondary storage

169
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780
so that it's permanently saved a lot

170
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.060
of time.

171
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.580
People try to just move things

172
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.060
quickly in 1.5x or 2x and then

173
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.100
realize, I don't get the confidence

174
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.860
about this because you didn't allow

175
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.500
your brain to process this and move

176
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.140
into secondary storage so that it's

177
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.980
permanent.

178
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.260
So please don't do this.

179
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.340
Enjoy, the style.

180
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.540
It's not a race, it's a marathon.

181
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.260
Once you do Python with me, you

182
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.660
never have to look back again.

183
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.220
This is not going to be a tutorial

184
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.660
help, and this is going to be one

185
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
of the course which you will

186
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.040
absolutely commit complete.

187
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.680
Yes.

188
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.800
And we do run, also a lot of reward

189
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.000
programs as well on Twitter.

190
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.560
Whoever completes some section or

191
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480
